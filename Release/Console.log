"Hello pilot. A group of pirate ships of the {7216,{value@XTM Generic Mission 004.Clanname}} clan has been stirring up a lot
of trouble lately. We finally got the clearance to do something about them.
Sadly neither the sector security forces nor the military can deal with them anytime soon.
That's why we decided to hire freelancers. You will be provided with a flight route which will take

The latest raid against our targets in {sector.name@L2M003XTC.MissionSector} was an utter failure! Based on their performance, we are ashamed to call the family involved in the assault a clan, they would seem to be no better than mere slaves!

Thanks to their stellar defeat, we are now left with a ruined reputation. How can we extort station owners when they think we're such pushovers? But rest assured brethren, for our end is not nigh. The respons

The latest operation against our enemies in {sector.name@L2M003XTC.MissionSector} was a complete success! We are more than proud to call the pirate clan involved in the raid a true family with proud piracy traditions running deep in their blood! For their efforts, they have gained great renown among our brethren.

The final result was greater than we could have anticipated, more than 17 new station owners have accepted our protection services, and

A long planned pirate raid was successfully neutralised in {sector.name@L2M003XTC.MissionSector}. It seems that the pirates of a well-known clan had chosen the sector as a place for both warning and punishment. They warned the station owners what would happen if they didn't pay for so-called 'protection', and then punished those that refused to pay.

That was the plan at least, but luckily the invasion was dealt with in a swift and decisive manner.

Unfortunately, we have to bring bad news to our readers. A pirate fleet recently entered {sector.name@L2M003XTC.MissionSector} and devastated everything there simply to show their might and influence over the area. The local military force commander said that he was aware of the impending raid, but there was no chance whatsoever for him to make it to the combat zone in time to prevent civilian casualties.

The most unfortunate part of this is that

Unfortunately there are number of slaves on that station, held as hostages to prevent a police raid.

Okay, pilot! We have docked at the pirate station. As soon as the marines override the security protocols on the airlock they will break into the station brick where the slaves were kept.

When they return with the slaves we will have a hell of a ride getting back home. I don't think the pirates will let us get away with this. Please watch our backs while we try and escape. Keep in mind that our marines are also trying to steal some berthed pirate
