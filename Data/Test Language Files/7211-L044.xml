    <t id="2252">BoGas factories artificially manufacture BoGas, which is only found in its natural state on the Boron home planet. These factories are simple affairs containing chemical mixtures in huge vats where the gas is formed naturally.(||) Large piping systems then drain the gas into decanting areas where it is put into large sealed cylinders for ease of transport. Traditionally these factories were constructed from metal made from ore supplied by the Argon, but throughout the last seventy jazuras the Boron have been refurbishing and re-equipping their BoGas factories using Teladianium.</t>
    <t id="2284">BoFu meals are known to be very nutritious and healthy. The Boron love them and it is said that their pilots can live on just a nugget of BoFu for almost a wozura.(||) BoFu is grown in special BoFu Chemical Labs from Plankton and other secret ingredients. Even though the Boron are famous among other races for their delicious Stott spices, the taste of BoFu is no joy to anybody but them.</t>
    <t id="2354">Chelts are marine animals that once roamed the seas and oceans on the Split home planet that the Split killed for meat, oil and their skins, which they processed to create a tough leather-like material. However, for many jazuras Chelts were over-hunted and almost brought to extinction. Nowadays Chelts are grown in space Chelt Aquariums and are later sold to Split food factories.</t>
    <t id="2603">(General description for all High Energy Plasma Throwers)The radiation is so dangerous that the weapon had to go through many jazuras of research and development until it could be placed on the market. This was worked around by adding a radiation sink into the weapon's main design, purging the weapon of all excess radiation between shots.</t>
    <t id="3112">The Colossus is the main carrier of the Argon military. As new technologies have been developed in recent jazuras, the design has undergone several major overhauls. With a large hangar capacity for fighters, strong shielding and numerous turret batteries, the Colossus is one of the most powerful vessels in the Argon fleet. Argon One, the flagship of the Argon fleet, maintains a dominant presence in Argon Prime.</t>
    <t id="3142">The Argon Buster was once the pride of the Argon fleet and was instrumental in gaining the Argon victory in the Xenon Conflict. However, during the Boron campaign, it was superseded by the Argon Elite.(||) Over the intervening jazuras the design of the Argon Buster has been modified and new, more powerful engines have been fitted. Now updated, the Buster is again a firm favourite of the Argon Fighter Command.</t>
    <t id="3182">A typical Argon Space station used throughout entire Argon federation territory. Developed by Argon over many jazuras, these space stations provide the highest standards of both comfort and technology.(||) Each station is fitted with bars, restaurants, casinos, holographic cinemas and accommodation. They are fine rest and recreation centres. Each space station is under the jurisdiction of the Argon Federation and is governed by an elected senator. He represents the station in the main Argon Senate. Pilots can expect friendly welcome.</t>
    <t id="3312">The Raptor is the Split carrier ship. It first made an appearance in the war against the Boron when it proved to be effective, but vulnerable to attack from beneath. It is believed that, over the intervening jazuras, the Split have redesigned the ship to eliminate this problem.(||) Normally these ships are commanded by high-ranking Split officers related by kin to the ruling family clan. Generally they are even more abrasive and arrogant than the other members of their race.</t>
    <t id="3332">A long-serving and deadly fighter developed by the Split Military. It has been only in recent jazuras that this ship has been made available to the public.(||) The current Split Patriarch has a small fleet of these ships that act as escort ships that accompany the primary destroyer of the fleet. In the hands of an experienced pilot, this ship can survive the darkest of battles, due to the ship's high speed it can avoid most of laser beams and missiles.</t>
    <t id="3342">A forerunner of this ship fought in the Boron Campaign and proved to be a pilot favourite. Like most other Split ships, this design focuses on high-speed engines and increased weapon power, at the cost of shield strength. Over the jazuras this ship had been frequently updated and rearmed in order to remain as deadly as possible.</t>
    <t id="3362">This huge Transporter is too large to dock in any space station and carries a number of smaller freighters to load and unload its trading goods.(||) It is believed that this Transporter is an evolutionary form of a much smaller Transporter called the Rhino, which seems to have been phased out over the last hundred jazuras. It is believed that a different Split family clan controls each transporter.</t>
    <t id="3632">Until recently the L was the most powerful Xenon fighter developed; it is armed with multiple lasers, and powerful shields.(||) These ships are often seen attacking passing ships trying to take shortcuts through their sectors. Like the other Xenon ships, the L has been updated in the last few jazuras.</t>
    <t id="4132">When the long serving Argon Elite was originally retired, the Argon military was left without an M3 fighter, that was until a group of Shipwrights in Omicron Lyrae put forward plans for a new type of ship. The Nova was born shortly afterwards, and after two jazuras of testing, virtually all of the older Elite class ship had been replaced by this new craft.(||) Capable of holding powerful weaponry and armed with an aft turret, the Nova is bound to serve the Argon military for many jazuras to come.</t>
    <t id="4212">The Boron Hydra is a new class of ship, corvettes were developed to give extra protection to large fleets of Transport craft, and to destroy any incoming missiles while the fighters dealt with the attacking vessels, a job that they still keep to this tazura as they are fast enough to keep up with a convoy.(||) It is also capable of holding one M5 class ship that can be used for various tasks.</t>
    <t id="4362">This fast transport ship has been in service for many jazuras now. The ship was originally built for slave transport, to ferry slaves from their point of capture to the factories where they would spend the rest of their tazuras.(||) Now the ship is used to transport personnel from sector to sector. It is armed with adequate weaponry, but its main defence is speed.</t>
    <t id="4472">The Demeter has been used for some jazuras now, replacing the old Paranid Ganymede model. It has improved on all of its predecessor's systems.(||) This ship was first brought into service to serve only the Paranid Fleet, but later slowly replaced the Ganymede because of its speed to bring the Paranid Economy back to levels of the Argon and Boron.</t>
    <t id="4512">The Osprey has undergone a significant redesign in recent jazuras in response to pilots' complaints about its speed. Originally developed as a heavy corvette with a large cargo capacity, recent updates have sought to redress the balance between size, speed and firepower.</t>
    <t id="5214">In recent jazuras the Argon Agriculture Council has decided that it is unsafe to use Natural Fertiliser from the Argnu Cattle. This artificial fertiliser created by the AAC contains all the essential elements that plants need for growth, but eliminates the ones that are harmful to other life-forms.</t>
    <t id="6854">Before developing the Firefly missile, the Argon Military refitted the Dragonfly missile with dumbfire protocols to greatly reduce the cost of manufacturing. The dumbfire Dragonfly replaces the now obsolete original. It continues in service to this tazura.</t>
    <t id="12952">The Galleon carrier represents many jazuras of secluded development and reverse-engineering by a cooperative of Pirate shipbuilders. Pirates can now project a fighter capability where it is most needed.</t>
    <t id="15222">The Hull Plating Production Facility is central to the Terran defence industry and forms an important part of the overall economy since the demand for military ships has gone through the roof in recent jazuras.</t>
    <t id="15224">The production of this advanced hull plating, made from a mixture of traditional metals and advanced polymers, has been ramped up significantly in recent jazuras due to increased shipbuilding activity by USC and the AGI Task Force for the defence of the Solar System.</t>
    <t id="15272">Terracorp Headquarters has made a significant contribution to the Argon economy and has, in recent jazuras, become a one-stop-shop for entrepreneurs equipping ships for a variety of tasks. Terracorp's strong mercantile base has allowed it to develop a formidable independent security arm, providing protection for its own and other companies' vessels. Julian Brennan, aka Julian Gardna, is a well-known former Terracorp employee.</t>
    <t id="16042">This shipyard serves as a USC ship-production and repair facility. The majority of the Terran fleet used to be produced at the Torus station around Earth. In recent jazuras increased security in the Earth sector and a huge rise in ship demand led to the building of this station.</t>

    <t id="19002">1 MJ Shield</t>
    <t id="19003">The 1 Mega-Joule shield is a tiny device, used mainly on scout class fighters, navigation beacons and other unimportant objects. Ever since it was first developed as a prototype of energetic shielding concept, it has experienced remarkably few changes. The capacity and size have remained the same, but regeneration rates have been boosted whilst reducing the strain on its power source. Nowadays, the 1 MJ shield is considered as means of minimum protection against the radiation of space and micro-particles. Not even mentioning stray weapon fire, the 1 MJ shields are known to be vulnerable even to collisions with spaceflies.</t>
    <t id="19004">5 MJ Shield</t>
    <t id="19005">The 5 Mega-Joule shield is used exclusively by interceptor class fighters. It provides basic protection against weak weaponry and space-born objects, but is relatively fragile in close combat situations. The small capacity is countered by the relatively quick recharge rates, which tend to put an unhealthy strain on smaller power generators. Though still incredibly fragile, it is a remarkable improvement over its predecessor, the 1 MJ shield.</t>
    <t id="19006">25 MJ Shield</t>
    <t id="19007">The 25 Mega-Joule shield is used mainly by heavy fighters, and is the largest fighter-class shield. The architecture of this shield is as old as shield technology itself, and over the jazuras has evolved very little. Even the current modules of the 25 MJ shields are just pre-production 1 MJ shields, packed in a tight array with universal power and output feeds. This device does offer protection against weaker lasers and random floating objects, but cannot prevent an overload once in contact with large surfaces, such as asteroids and capital ships. Though light by current standards, it still manages to strain the energy generators of most fighters to the max.</t>
    <t id="19008">125 MJ Shield</t>
    <t id="19009">The 125 Mega-Joule shield is used by corvettes as well as military and passenger transporters. It is light and effective, but does not provide a thorough protection against all weapons. These shields were once used to protect the 2nd generation capital ships, but times have changed and now this barely modified version is considered to be little more than a twin-pack of fighter shields. Even so, it is still a hundred and twenty-five times more powerful than the base-line 1 MJ shield.</t>
    <t id="19010">500 MJ Shield</t>
    <t id="19011">The 500 Mega-Joule shield is used mainly by frigates, missile frigates and basic trader ships. Though physically small, the output capacity and the energy toll of this device is significant enough to prohibit its use outside the aforementioned classes. Efficient, capable and yet affordable, this shield is favoured by many privately-owned capital ship captains as well, who use their ships for non-combat purposes.</t>
    <t id="19012">2 GJ Shield</t>
    <t id="19013">The 2 Giga-Joule shield is used exclusively by large capital ships due to its sheer mass and energy requirements. A small number of trading ships have also been upgraded to fit these shields, though at a reduced output efficiency. This type of shield is the largest single device aboard any ship, and is stretching the limits of what the current generation of spaceships can physically support. The peak capacity of this shield is equal to two thousand serially-linked 1MJ shields. Unlike all other shields that are measured in Mega-Joules rather than Giga-Joules, the 2 GJ shields are made on entirely different design principles, essentially making them smaller versions of stationary shielding arrays.</t>
    <!-- military shield set-->
    <t id="19014">1 MJ Mil. Shield</t>
    <t id="19015">The 1 Mega-Joule Military shield is a modified shield unit, intended for use on scout class ships designated for reconnaissance in hostile territories. While this is a notable improvement over the basic 1MJ shield, prolonged combat is not recommended.</t>
    <t id="19016">5 MJ Mil. Shield</t>
    <t id="19017">The 5 Mega-Joule Military shield is used exclusively by interceptor class fighters. While the capacity of this shield module is analogous to that of the regular 5MJ shield, the military variant offers better recharge rates and increased durability of internal electronics.</t>
    <t id="19018">25 MJ Mil. Shield</t>
    <t id="19019">The 25 Mega-Joule Military shield is the shielding of choice for most heavy fighters in response task forces. With higher recharge rates and improved integration with the ship's reactor, this version can often maximize the potential of the ship, and in some cases turn the outcome of an actual battle.</t>
    <t id="19020">125 MJ Mil. Shield</t>
    <t id="19021">The 125 Mega-Joule Military shield was designed for active-service corvette class ships, tasked with patrolling potentially dangerous areas. This shield is more effective and efficient than its civilian alternative, but the benefit comes at the expense of an increased production cost.</t>
    <t id="19022">500 MJ Mil. Shield</t>
    <t id="19023">The 500 Mega-Joule Military shield is most commonly seen on military frigates and drone carriers. This variant has improved upon its baseline predecessor in several areas, most notable of those being the integration method between the shield's capacitors and the ship's power feed.</t>
    <t id="19024">2 GJ Mil. Shield</t>
    <t id="19025">The 2 Giga-Joule Military shield is the most refined shielding module in use. Offering immense capacity and innovative multi-feed recharge system, this military module easily outclasses its standard-type predecessor. While production costs are higher, top-of-the-line military ships are favouring these shields purely because of the edge they provide in any combat situation.</t>

    <t id="19261">Coffee is brewed from the roasted beans of the coffee plant and loved by all races for its energizing effect and its wonderful taste. Equally, it is hated by all dieticians and personal trainers. The coffee plant can only be found on one planet in the known universe, Earth. Coffee quickly became Earth's primary export, and large coffee-house chains control the market. The export of living coffee plants off world is prohibited. Each plant is genetically encoded and altered so they can only survive on Earth. These changes have led the produced coffee to have increased amounts of caffeine up to such a level that the actual drink is thought to be more addictive than spaceweed. Today a coffee-house of the Kevso Company can be found on nearly every trading station. In Split sectors only decaffeinated coffee is allowed after the incident known as "the coffeehouse massacre".</t>

The actual product is said to bear some uncertain relation to a popular fast-food of the 20th century, but any proof of that assertion remains to be found. As it stands now, the donut is a semi-liquid ingestible pulp, designed to accelerate the growth of Adipocytes in a living organism and provide minimal nutritional value. Despite the fact that this product is thought harmful and classed as an additive, it still catches a fair price on most food outlets on stations. Incidentally, most official police forces do indeed use the product as a mild toxin for calming convicts.</t>

    <t id="20002">AP Gunner</t>
    <t id="20003">The oldest design in use now; though it has seen many improvements and composition changes, the actual Type IV corvette chassis has seen very few structural changes since its use in the schematics of the AP Gunner, the vessel that propelled Nathan R. Gunne beyond the Sol system into the X-Universe.</t>

    <!-- Leviathan -->
    <t id="20004">Leviathan</t>
    <t id="20005">
     The Leviathan class Battlecruiser is the largest and heaviest warship constructed by the Argon navy to date. The production requirements of this vessel exceeded the design parameters of Argon shipyards, which needed to be refitted in order to accommodate the vast resources and 78,000 personnel involved in the construction process. As a symbol of Argon naval prowess, the size and strength of the Leviathan are unmatched, protected by the heaviest armour and armaments ever seen on a spacefaring vessel. 24 heavy turrets on each flank can deliver a broadside capable of destroying a frigate in a single salvo.\n\n

      Though they serve as the command centres and flagships of the Argon navy, Leviathans are rarely mobilized for active combat, partly due to the prohibitive fuel, maintenance and ordnance requirements for a vessel of this size, but also due to the huge blow that would occur to fleet morale should such a figurehead of Argon might be destroyed.

    <!-- OTAS Elite -->
    <t id="20006">OTAS {17,10101}</t>
    <t id="20007">
     When the news came that the Elite was to be phased out in favour of the Nova, there was a wave of retirements, with many of Argon's most veteran pilots choosing not to continue their careers. From icon to scrap heap, or so it seemed until it in recent times was confirmed that the OTAS Corporation would be selling the new Argon Elite refits.\n\n

      With shielding equal to the newer Argon Nova, the refitted Elite is capable of greater speeds while also having significantly increased weapons capabilities. It is thought that while being mostly Argon based, the OTAS Elite uses a combination of Boron shield technology and a hybrid Split reactor, allowing the ship to obtain the best of both worlds. More worrying reports also indicate sightings of old similarly refitted Argon Elites now under pirate control. These ships are thought to be faster and more manoeuvrable, though less shielded and less powerful than the OTAS variant.

    <!-- Ganymede -->
    <t id="20008">{17,3471}</t>
    <t id="20009">The Ganymede is a luxury cruise ship developed by the Jonferco Space Dynamics Division for the Goner faction. Sleek and fast, it provides excellent service in VIP-class transportation, but, as all other Goner ships, the Ganymede is unable to retaliate when attacked. Pilots of this vessel are known to prefer going down in a blaze of glory, which is an especially spectacular sight in such a ship - though the rumours of special explosive-combustive alloy embedded in the hull for more impressive explosions are greatly exaggerated. The Ganymedes are mostly used for securely transporting high-ranking Goner officials between various embassies and Goner temples. For that reason, this ship does have limited atmospheric flight capability, though it cannot penetrate beyond the outermost layers of a planet's stratosphere.</t>

    <t id="20011">Though slow, outdated and in some cases barely spaceworthy by modern manufacturing standards, the market for retrofitted Mk1 model corvettes remains strong among vintage collectors and pilots operating on a tight budget. Spare parts are no longer available for these ships, however, and the need to cannibalize some for the benefit of others has reduced numbers even further in recent jazuras.</t>

    <!-- Amaranth -->
    <t id="20012">Amaranth</t>
    <t id="20013">The Amaranth is a mobile hydroponics station, a large array of factory biodomes strapped on a basic hull, capable of producing the majority of known bio-substances in flight. Surplus gasses are used in its power generators, but for active production, a constant supply of energy is still required. Affectingly called the 'Gassers' by the captains of these impressively large vessels, the Amaranths are known to continually fly throughout the universe, selling their wares on the go. Even though the ship is minimally armed, the relatively large shielding and common escort wings tend to repel any raider threat, though part of the reason for the lack of threats lies with the product; no self-respecting pirate would risk his neck for a cache of BoFu.</t>

    <!-- Panos -->
    <t id="20014">Panos</t>
    <t id="20015">The Panos is a mobile mineral extraction plant. It is capable of extracting Ore, Silicon, Ice and even Nividium from any sufficiently large asteroid, as long as it is within transporter range and its energy cell supply is constant. As Transporter device technology is used in the extraction routine, a one-time fee is included in the initial purchase price of the ship to cover all licensing costs. Though it operates with highly volatile chemicals and experimental software subroutines, the ship is essentially harmless, relying on shielding, escorts and jumpdrive to escape any danger.</t>

    <!-- Darius -->
    <t id="20016">Darius</t>
    <t id="20017">The Darius is a mobile technology forge. Vast numbers of station-based tech modules were installed in the framework of this ship, giving it the ability to produce a vast array of technological trinkets, as long as proper resources are provided. Initially limited to Crystal production, this ship saw a great leap in demand once Argon tech-heads cracked the software limiters and opened up compatibility for any ware production. Now, this crack has been implemented as an unofficial patch on all new vessels of this type, and the ability to produce any ware is officially permitted, though the price of the ship has risen accordingly.</t>

    <!-- Vulcan -->
    <t id="20018">Vulcan</t>
    <t id="20019">
      The Vulcan class armoured personnel carrier and transport once functioned as a frontline supply ship for the Argon military. Designed to operate under heavy fire and in the midst of fighting, it is heavily armed and can support corvette class shielding.\n\n
      Although recently retired from active military use and no longer in mass production, remaining Vulcans are now widely available to commercial pilots via navy surplus dealers, where they are becoming popular among traders and private companies with high risk investments.

    <!-- Ragnarök -->
    <t id="20020">Ragnarök</t>
    <t id="20021">After Earth was reconnected to the gate network it quickly became apparent that the pride of the ATF - the Valhalla - was unable to perform jumps through gates. The Ragnarök is the direct successor of the Valhalla and was designed with gate limitations in mind. As a result, the ship is longer and narrower, but it has not lost any volume or technology. Due to the excessive length of the ship, several spine-mounted high-speed elevators were taken straight out of the Earth's Torus and placed in the Ragnarök's structure. Naturally, there are regular staircases in case the electronics of the ship break down, but field tests show that it would take a marine 4,7 stazuras to traverse the ship fore to aft on foot.</t>

    <t id="20024">Ollerus</t>
    <t id="20025">
      The Ollerus is a special craft designed for the repair and deployment of the Trans-Orbital Accelerators used by the Terrans. Although these ships have no offensive capability, they play an important strategic and logistic role in the Terran United Space Command alongside their normal duties. Two Trans-Orbital Accelerators can theoretically link any two points of the known universe, allowing unlimited possibilities for trade, fleet deployment and resupply. \n\n
      While older Trans-Orbital Accelerators required deployment near LaGrange points where the gravity of two stellar bodies cancel each other out, new Accelerators can be deployed almost anywhere by using modified inertial dampers to offset the trajectory deviations caused by gravity well distortion, thus preventing disastrous mis-jumps hundreds of light jazuras off course and allowing their deployment almost anywhere. An Ollerus can also place Terran Gate structures and use them to re-activate abandoned and disconnected gates left by the Ancients.

    <!-- Asgard -->
    <t id="20026">Asgard</t>
    <t id="20027">Considered the most war-like TL in the known universe, the Asgard can function as both a heavy transport and a military vessel with equal proficiency. Capable of packing an impressive punch and with excellent shielding, Asgards are often deployed to support and resupply large parts of the Terran capital fleet during patrols and engagements. Based on their performance, the United Space Command has declared that a new ship class, the 'General Systems Vehicle' or GSV, should be recognized. They are capable of serving as military, colony, supply, defence and trade ships. If the GSV is indeed admitted, the Asgard would be the very first design of the list.</t>
	
    <!-- Sleipnir -->
    <t id="20028">Sleipnir</t>
    <t id="20029">The Sleipnir is the workhorse of the Terran fleet, initially devised as a tender for the AGI Task Force and sold to public Terran shipyards afterwards. A generously armed bulk transporter that has strong defensive capabilities, it is well adapted for trans-sector trading outside of the core systems.</t>
	
    <!-- XXL Cluster -->
    <t id="20030">{17,4061} {12,505}</t>
    <t id="20031">This new type of Kha'ak Cluster is extremely dangerous. Experts speculate that the development and deployment of this new type was triggered by the more hostile environment of this section of space. Unlike other previously encountered clusters, this one has a central structure that is discarded after ship deployment.</t>
	
    <!-- Loki -->
    <t id="20032">Loki</t>
    <t id="20033">The Loki is an armoured personnel carrier and troop transport in common use by the Terran United Space Command. It is both fast and well defended, but the main feature of the ship is the modular design that allows it to be made on a fully automatic conveyor band.</t>
	
    <!-- Baldur -->
    <t id="20034">Baldur</t>
    <t id="20035">Based on the schematics of the Xperimental Shuttle that Kyle Brennan flew when he first entered the Commonwealth, the Baldur is a well built and compact Transporter. Designed to run border sector trade runs, it is capable of defending itself against raiding parties and even take out weaker enemy ships. Though the design has aged by now, these ships are still as reliable as the day they were first built.</t>

    <!-- Raven -->
    <t id="20036">{17,16561}</t>
    <t id="20037">The Raven is an experimental vessel developed by an independent mercenary cluster - SartCorp. Using the frame of a pirate frigate, it is the first known step to integrate Xenon weapon systems into a new Commonwealth ship design. Unfortunately, it proved to be only a partial success, as the ship vented its air supply on the first test flights and headed off into deep space. It was recovered only when it smashed into a large asteroid, several light-sezuras away. Only key systems were salvaged, and the bulk of the wreck still lies on a forgotten rock deep in the vast reaches of space.</t>
	
    <!-- Hydra Advanced -->
    <t id="20038">{17,4211}</t>
    <t id="20039">Once the Boron determined that the basic Hydra corvette was considered the worst of its class, two teams of scientists began working on an upgraded version. This ship was the result of the design race. Unfortunately, whilst having better combat capabilities than its counterpart, the cost for mass development of these Advanced Hydras was deemed too high for the Boron military. A private benefactor soon took control of the project, and financed the distribution of the ships in the Boron Kingdom. Still, they have remained extremely rare and valuable, and are mostly used as status symbols more than anything else.</t>
	
    <!-- Retrofitted Hydra -->
    <t id="20040">Retrofitted {17,4211}</t>
    <t id="20041">Though slow, outdated and in some cases barely spaceworthy by modern manufacturing standards, the market for retrofitted Mk1 model corvettes remains strong among vintage collectors and pilots operating on a tight budget.

    <t id="20042">Swordfish</t>
    <t id="20043">The Swordfish is the new stage of anti-capital ship warfare for the Boron.

    <!-- Penatron -->
    <t id="20060">{17,6231}</t>
    <t id="20061">The Penatron is a larger and heavier version of the basic Goner ship, manufactured on special order basis by Jonferco Space Dynamics Division. Intended as the vessel of choice for dangerous operations and preaching in hostile environments, the ship was built with speed and endurance in mind. Boasting numerous failsafes and other technological breakthroughs, the ship is extremely reliable in problematic situations, such as flying through corrosive gas clouds or enduring tau-neutrino hull bombardment. The paintjob of the ship has been discussed ever since it was first produced. Numerous people have implied that the lead designer was a drug addict or an artist, though the true reason is much more sophisticated. The colours and pattern was designed specifically to encumber any visual recognition systems, like the ones used in most missiles, thus giving the ship increased chances to avoid trailing missiles and enemy fire. The allegation that the colour patterns play havoc with passing spacefly swarm formations has not been discussed publicly.</t>
	
    <!-- Tempestine -->
    <t id="20062">{17,6221}</t>
    <t id="20063">The Tempestine is the basic Goner personnel transporter. Designed by Jonferco Space Dynamics Division in order to offer free transportation to new Goner converts, both interior and exterior designers have tried to keep any features as aesthetic and subtle as possible. The result is a surprisingly sleek ship with a particularly featureless interior. It is a well-known saying that the Tempestine is the best thing you can see in the universe, and the most boring thing you can fly in. Like all other Goner ships, the Tempestine is completely unarmed, relying on its speed, shape, luck and goodwill of other races to protect the passengers.</t>

    <!-- Solitas-->
    <t id="20064">{17,6201}</t>
    <t id="20065">The Solitas is a vastly modified Centaur, developed by Jonferco Space Dynamics Division and used by reclusive Goner priests to conduct their preaching tours and deep space exploration. With the sizable crew quarters of the ship, paired with three canteens and a bridge as vast as seen on frigates, the priest captains can live onboard for jazuras without interruption. Quite often, these ships can be noticed in remote edges of space, seemingly drifting meekly just to jump away when the observer gets close. Any rumours of armed versions of these ships have been dismissed as ridiculous. The ship's only defence is its speed, shielding and the masterful use of an emergency jumpdrive.</t>
	
    <!-- Dreadnought -->
    <t id="20066">Dreadnought</t>
    <t id="20067">The Kha'ak Dreadnought is the most powerful Kha'ak combat ship ever observed. It is much larger than the Destroyer, and has more powerful weapon batteries and shields. All encounters with these ships have ended in the destruction of the opposition, rendering any uncoordinated resistance futile. It is speculated that more than one flagship would be required to take down the Dreadnought. Whether it is automated or flown by actual Kha'ak is unknown, but the design and size suggest that it is not a mass-production vessel and possibly unique to this specific Kha'ak Hive.</t>

    <!-- Sentinel -->
    <t id="20068">{17,10002}</t>
    <t id="20069">The Kha'ak Sentinel seems to be a deliberate response to the development of M3+ heavy fighters. Its offensive and defensive abilities are still under analysis, though it is highly aggressive and has already been declared a class B shipping lane threat. Civilian vessels are strongly advised to employ defensive manoeuvres on sighting, and signal S.I.D. distress response immediately.</t>
	
    <!-- Vanguard -->
    <t id="20070">{17,10001}</t>
    <t id="20071">These ships are often seen recklessly attacking to the very end, as if their pilots know no fear. They are fast and extremely well armed, but only lightly shielded for their class. Rumour has it that these ships lack even basic life support units.</t>

    <!-- Frigate -->
    <t id="20072">Frigate</t>
    <t id="20073">The appearance of this vessel is an alarming development in Kha'ak technology. All traders are urged to report any sightings of these vessels to sector authorities immediately. The capabilities of these larger ships are as of yet unknown, but it is believed that they are faster than many frigates with similar offensive capability, and they should therefore be avoided at all costs.</t>
	
    <!-- Sturgeon -->
    <t id="20074">{17,16491}</t>
    <t id="20075">The Boron Sturgeon is a heavily armoured alternative to the aging Dolphin. Whilst newer, the design is still experimental and subject to unexpected errors and flight-issues. Despite that, the Kingdom of Boron is constantly funding further development of the ship. Deemed stable enough for mass use, the prototype was released to the public a few mazuras ago. The current iteration has a few updates to navigation system, but otherwise it is no different from the first iteration.</t>

    <!-- Drake -->
    <t id="20076">{17,16641}</t>
    <t id="20077">This heavily armed freight transporter was recently called into service to provide a more secure way of ferrying top-grade military equipment. Armed with several turrets and exceptional defences, the Drake is quite possibly the most aggressive transporter in the universe. Though the ship appears slow and bulky, the engines were specifically upgraded to provide acceleration and speed unmatched by any other vessel of its class. Split military forces have employed a garrison of these ships and retrofitted them for high-yield explosive compatibility. These ships are then stripped of most equipment and used as lures for pirate raiders. The Split generals say that the cost of this ship is nothing compared to the sight of the explosion it provides.</t>
	
    <!-- Toukon -->
    <t id="20078">{17,16711}</t>
    <t id="20079">The United Space Command designed the Toukon after seeing the value of the TM class ships used by the Commonwealth races. Intended to serve as a rapid response patrol carrier, the Toukon improves on established designs without adding any experimental or unstable features. Essentially a Terran version of the widely successful Magnetar, the Toukon combines the best of two worlds with virtually no downsides.</t>

    <!-- Hayabusa -->
    <t id="20080">{17,16731}</t>
    <t id="20081">Feeling the need for better protection of military grade equipment transports, the United Space Command submitted a request to ship design teams to create a heavily armoured transporter with capacity for high-volume freight. The Hayabusa was the result. Numerous layers of armour plating on top of a triple-hull system, paired with military-grade energy generators and finely tuned engines, enable this ship to ferry highly sensitive equipment in any imaginable circumstance. The designers of this ship boast that it could easily do a cargo run even through an AGI blockade with minimal damage.</t>

    <!-- Castrum -->
    <t id="20082">Castrum</t>
    <t id="20083">This OTAS battlecruiser class vessel is capable of docking multiple corvettes and is well suited to the role of fleet command vessel or mothership. It is heavily armed with multiple heavy weapon batteries and is well protected due to the special electronic warfare systems on board. Though smaller and more agile than most other super-heavy capital ships, it is no less powerful, mainly due to advanced miniaturization techniques developed by the OTAS Corporation.</t>
	
    <!-- Reaper -->
    <t id="20084">Reaper</t>
    <t id="20085">Built and sold to wealthy private owners by the OTAS Corporation, the Reaper is an advanced corvette class vessel equipped with heavy shields and a formidable forward weapons array. Because of its huge forward-focused damage potential, it has attracted many bounty hunters for its ability to attack classes of ships which would usually cause the lone pilot problems, such as frigates and even carriers.</t>

    <!-- Custodian -->
    <t id="20086">Custodian</t>
    <t id="20087">This OTAS support frigate is an experimental design, intended to support heavier ships with their own weapons and partially keep enemy fighters away from blind spots of the larger ships.</t>

    <!-- Scarab -->
    <t id="20088">Scarab</t>
    <t id="20089">The wealthy OTAS Corporation devised this ship to cater the ever-growing need for fast, cheap and reliable transportation of various wares that outsourced traders could just not provide. Built with the specific needs of OTAS Corp. in mind, the Scarab is nevertheless a surprisingly well-received transporter, a firm favourite of independent traders due to its speed-to-cargo ratio. With average shielding, basic weaponry and standard systems, the Scarab is a ship made for long, determined service rather than a short-lived and expensive life as a party piece.</t>

    <!-- Olympos -->
    <t id="20090">Olympos</t>
    <t id="20091">The Olympos class battlecruiser represents the Imperial Paranid Navy's foray into the realm of the new class, a crowning achievement of Paranid technology and engineering. By sheer scale alone this vessel dwarfs most other capital ships, and its turret batteries alone are larger than most corvettes. A high-positioned aft bridge allows the commander of the ship to survey the battlefield and the ship at once. The Olympos' design was improved only once, to cover up huge holes in its armour that the Paranid had left due to resource mismanagement.</t>
	
    <!-- Nemesis Advanced -->
    <t id="20092">{17,4411}</t>
    <t id="20093">The Nemesis Advanced was designed to act as a support and escort vessel for patrols led by the failed Agamemnon design. Specifically engineered to counter the leader ship's downsides, the development of this Nemesis version ceased when the Agamemnon was discontinued. Over the following mazuras, some shipyards acquired the license to produce these ships according to the prototype blueprints. Nowadays, the Nemesis Advanced can rarely be seen in space, seldom used by the military but favoured as a personal vessel of mercenaries due to its unique design and aggressive profile, perfectly suited for close-range combat and hit'n'run tactics. Even on such an unrefined stage, the Nemesis Advanced is an extremely potent assault vessel, a solid proof of why the Paranid military ships are renowned throughout the known universe.</t>

      A powerful ship only recently confirmed to be part of the Imperial Paranid Navy, the Poseidon is intended as a long-term replacement for the ageing Odysseus due to the ships' alarming increase in technical failures and recent poor combat performance against enemy incursions.\n\n
      As it was found that the Odysseus was unable to properly defend itself when attacked from above or beneath, the Poseidon made up for its predecessor's weaknesses by creating a smaller profile and more effective turret coverage. However, because of the greatly reduced size of the Poseidon, its power generators cannot maintain the same level of shielding. The Poseidon compensates for this through its state of the art weaponry and internal as well as external defence systems. Information regarding the power and nature of these defence systems is currently classified to halt the development of countermeasures by foreign powers, mercenaries and pirate clans.

    <t id="20103">
      When the news came that the Elite was to be phased out in favour of the Nova, there was a wave of retirements, with many of Argon's most veteran pilots choosing not to continue their careers. From icon to scrap heap, or so it seemed until it was confirmed that the OTAS Corporation would be selling the new Argon Elite refits. \n\n
      With shielding equal to the newer Argon Nova, the refitted Elite is capable of greater speeds while also having significantly increased weapons capabilities. It is thought that while being mostly Argon based, the OTAS Elite uses a combination of Boron shield technology and a hybrid Split reactor, allowing the ship to obtain the best of both worlds. More worrying reports also indicate sightings of old Argon Elites now under pirate control. These ships are thought to be faster and more manoeuvrable, but less well shielded and less powerful than the OTAS refitted variant.

    <t id="20113">Following the trend of employing drone carriers in border patrol duty, a strategy established by the Argon with their successful Griffon prototype, the Paranid Empire issued an order for a drone frigate design of their own, superior to the early Griffon variations in every way. The current Ariadne, the result of several mazuras of corporate espionage and plain copying, is indeed a vastly improved version of the Argon prototype. Unfortunately, the Ariadne is a relatively new ship, so it still retains a number of issues that would not appear in a more polished, finalized version. Due to pressure from the Priest Kings, the prototype Ariadne designs were sent to all major Paranid shipyards before the actual ship could be run through field tests. Nevertheless, the military has not reported any major issues with the ship as yet, so for all intents and purposes, it is a proper drone frigate, well worth its price.</t>

Cheap, rough, sturdy and absolutely ignorant of any aesthetical rules, the Cormorant fulfils its major function - drone management - without any unnecessary fuss. Though production quality is estimated to be extremely low, there are as yet no known cases of these ships spontaneously exploding in flight.

Sleek, spacious and menacing, the Guppy is an excellent border patrol leader. Though it is not the leading vessel in individual characteristics comparison among the other drone frigates, the Guppy is the best-rounded and balanced one. It is estimated to be almost twice as expensive to produce as regular frigates, but the Guppy is still relatively affordable thanks to vast government funding. Even so, this ship has acquired a status quo in the industry, serving as a symbol of its class.</t>

The development of the Maccana is still ongoing, but spaceworthy test versions have been released for the general market, as field tests have proved that it is essentially safe and stable.</t>

    <t id="20145">The Faunus is a mobile array of adaptive weapon manufacturing modules, fitted on a basic framework enabling space travel. Though more similar to a station than a ship, the Faunus is still sufficiently mobile to traverse gates and sectors.

Unlike true solar power plants, the Anastasius uses its onboard power generator to convert the energy and pack it into energy cells, though crystals do accelerate the process. The rest of the ship - namely the backbone, engines and bridge - is extremely utilitarian in design, built on the premise that price being the sole limiting factor. The mobile factory ships are known to be rough and simplistic above all else, but the Anastasius possesses that little bit of additional sleekness, if you look close enough.</t>

    <t id="20222">Ancient {17,20213}</t>
    <t id="20223">Ancient Ice Beetles are almost completely solidified inside and out, with only their brain remaining relatively soft. They are known to stay very close to asteroid fields, as if choosing their final resting place. As the brain grows more and more solid, the Beetle becomes slower and duller, until it finally passes away and becomes indistinguishable from a regular Ice asteroid.</t>

    <t id="20224">Space Nettle</t>
    <t id="20225">{17,20224} Hatchling</t>
    <t id="20226">Baby Nettles tend to be playful and agile, drifting far apart from their pack and taking an interest into anything. Their bodies do not yet have the residual sheen of a grown-up Nettle, and their tentacles are as yet uncoordinated and slow.</t>
    <t id="20227">Juvenile {17,20224}</t>
    <t id="20228">Juvenile Nettles are more serious and calm than before, but have still retined all agility and speed despite their increased volume. Their bodies are quite adept at using up all sorts of energy, and though solar radiation is completely sufficient for them, they don't mind feasting on floating energy cells. Once provoked, they release a blast of surplus energy they may have stored.</t>
    <t id="20229">Adult {17,20224}</t>
    <t id="20230">Adult Space Nettles move purposefully, without the random, twitching movements young Nettles tend to show. The Adult Nettles are able to convert vast quantities of solar radiation into useful and excess energy, though they don't mind snacking on residual energy released by stations or floating energy cells. Their tentacles are fully developed and move in a synchronous fashion. If provoked, they release a blast of surplus energy that they have accumulated during their travels.</t>
    <t id="20231">Elder {17,20224}</t>
    <t id="20232">Elder Space Nettles tend to move gracefully and take into account the movement of every single atomic particle around them. Often this movement inspires wonder and though, subtly dazzling the observer ... until.. Oooh, hypnotic....</t>
    <t id="20233">Ancient {17,20224}</t>
    <t id="20234">Ancient Space Nettles are eating up more energy than necessary, resulting in an accumulation of a surplus that may kill the Nettle unless it is vented. The instinctive hunger does not help, and Ancient Space Nettles will gorge on floating energy cells and residual radiation from solar power plants even when already full to the bursting. Once provoked, they release a blast of surplus energy, particularly lethal at this stage.</t>

    <!-- Falchion -->
    <t id="20235">{17,16801}</t>
    <t id="20236">The Falchion is an advanced interceptor employed by the United Space Command forces. Designed to counter the major downsides of the Sabre, the Falchion has quickly proved to be a firm favourite of navy personnel and pilots alike. The main feature of this ship is the power generator of the latest generation, producing nearly twice as much energy as a similarly-sized older model. This has led to the increase of pilot's compartments at no expense on account of on-board tech. The armour plating has been reduced, however, as shielding has taken the task of blocking out radiation and small objects. This has led the ship to be called the 'tissue box' by some pilots. Nevertheless, it is a potent vessel, well adjusted to its role as a heavy interceptor.</t>
	
    <!-- Kobe -->
    <t id="20237">Kobe</t>
    <t id="20238">The Kobe is a factory transporter, an efficient redesign of the established TL framework bolstered with contemporary technology. Looks and sleekness characteristic to other USC capital ship designs were sacrificed in order to provide more freedom with technological aspects and cargo capacity. Though the Kobe is a technological masterpiece, it is still regarded as a utility vessel, destined for a single task.</t>

    <!-- Shamshir -->
    <t id="20241">{17,16791}</t>
    <t id="20242">This newly developed corvette incorporates civilian design cues in a thorough military framework, implementing numerous technology upgrades and experimental sensor arrays embedded in the hull. The turret placement was carefully devised before anything else, ensuring that the ship would not be helpless against fighters all by itself. The ship was intended to serve as a replacement for the Katana, but due to the increased production cost, it was relegated to the duty of an alternative corvette instead.</t>

    <!-- Emeus -->
    <t id="20243">{17,16541}</t>
    <t id="20244">The Emeus was created to fill the role of a light rapid-response destroyer. Statistically, the Emeus is a weaker, yet more agile capital ship than the Phoenix, but it makes up for any deficiencies with reduced price and innovative design. This ship is one of the few craft outfitted with special shield conductors, which are embedded in vital nodes of the ship's structure. Unlike older ships, that use two major nodes to emit the energy shield, the Emeus uses 38 smaller nodes, allowing the shield to be maintained at full capacity even with half of the ship's electronics crashing down. The design of the Emeus has been discussed among the pilots, as many are surprised with the beak-like structure on the ship's fore, a characteristic common to smaller fighters, not capital ships.</t>

    <!-- Phoenix -->
    <t id="20245">{17,3521}</t>
    <t id="20246">The current Phoenix is actually a greatly improved version of the original. Still more than 4 kilometres long, it has gathered several additional armour layers and additional engine improvements. The turret conductors were strengthened to provide greater ability to mount heavy weapons, and shield arrays were redesigned from scratch. As a result, the Phoenix is now considered a battlecruiser, a last-resort vessel reserved for the most dangerous emergencies. Though the price is steep, the Teladi military has secured a number of these ships for their Profit Corps main fleet. Thanks to the recent modifications, the Phoenix can still be considered the toughest, largest vessel in known space, one of the very few mobile objects capable of simply smashing through any blockade without structural damage.</t>
	
    <!-- Taipan -->
    <t id="20247">{17,16671}</t>
    <t id="20248">Seeing the advances of other races in the super-heavy destroyer field, the Split Patriarch Rhonkar ordered a new flagship to be built in utmost secrecy. The initial designs were conceived three jazuras ago, but the prototype had so many deficiencies that it exploded upon its first field test. After mazuras of complete overworking of all schematics, the current design of the Taipan was created. The ship follows the Split idiom of 'guns first, shields last'. It is arguably the most aggressive thing found in Split space, capable of annihilating whole squadrons of corvettes and frigates. To this day, only seven of these ships have been destroyed, and only once in a combat situation. For operations where initiative and aggression is the key, the Taipan is the best ship imaginable.</t>
	
    <!-- Panther -->
    <t id="20249">{17,12931}</t>
    <t id="20250">Initially designed as a mini-carrier, the Panther proved ineffective in real combat situations and unsuitable for supporting large pilot crews for extended periods of time. With the advance of drone manufacturing technology, the Panther was quickly remodelled to serve as a drone frigate. The improved concept proved itself worthy after a single mazura of automated patrols. Thanks to the new sensor array, the Panther can manage a large amount of drones over great distances. The numerous failsafes installed by outsourced Teladi engineers ensure that the Panther's drones can operate without supervision for extended periods of time.</t>

    <!-- Snotra -->
    <t id="20251">{17,16851}</t>
    <t id="20252">The Snotra was designed to cover the one area the aging Demeter could not fulfil - rapid transportation of high-risk military grade hardware. Following the latest Paranid design trends inspired by prototype ships like the Agamemnon and Heavy Nemesis, the Snotra has lost its former basic utility structure in favour of a more elaborate, artistic shape. The core of the ship has not changed greatly, though - the basic cargo compression systems are taken directly out of other transporters, and interior decorations have been left at a minimum. Though the Snotra was built as a militaristic ship, it is available to any trader rich and influential enough to afford one. </t>
	
    <!-- Verdandi -->
    <t id="20253">{17,16841}</t>
    <t id="20254">The Verdandi is an exceptionally rare corvette employed by the AGI Task Force. A limited number of these ships were made on a strict government order basis - up until now, no permission to manufacture or sell them to civilians has been issued. Technically, the Verdandi is an extremely potent warship, but as these ships are mostly used in covert classified operations, no reliable data of field performance is available.</t>

    <!-- Kvasir -->
    <t id="20255">{17,16871}</t>
    <t id="20256">The Kvasir is a heavy interceptor, employed by the AGI Task Force. Visually similar to its lesser counterpart, the Mjollnir, the Kvasir sacrifices some speed and crew space for increased combat capabilities - mainly better weapon- and shield generators. The Kvasir is mostly used in open engagements - a wing of Kvasirs is arguably the best defence against enemy bombers and heavy fighter squadrons. If necessary, the Kvasir can substitute as a heavy fighter, but the performance is still limited to what one could expect from a ship of its class.</t>

    <!-- Notus -->
    <t id="20257">{17,11131}</t>
    <t id="20258">The Notus is essentially an armed and armoured high-tech transporter. Equipped with a number of turrets and bolstered shield generators, it is best used for transporting high-volume equipment over potentially hostile territory. The Argon military has begun using the Notus transporters to supply the fleet in several hotspots, negating the need to wear out the jumpdrives. The Notus strikes a decent balance between speed, defence and power, making it one of the hottest trading vessels of the last jazura.</t>
	
    <!-- Griffon -->
    <t id="20259">{17,12871}</t>
    <t id="20260">The Griffon was the very first drone frigate built by the Argons. Developed with technology bought from the black market, initially originating from Aldrin, its design is surprisingly simple: An exposed framework supporting the drones, a single assembly line and modified sensor arrays are all that sets this frigate apart from any other capital ship. Even though there are newer, more technologically advanced drone frigates out there, the Griffon has had the time to be refined and augmented several times; the current version of the Griffon is arguably the most reliable frigate in the known universe, with 11 layers of failsafes and multiple redundancies.</t>
	
    <!-- Kyoto -->
    <t id="20261">Kyoto</t>
    <t id="20262">Seeing the need for a more powerful destroyer that would not be controlled strictly by the AGI Task Force, the United Space Command opted to develop their own super-heavy destroyer to take over tasks that the ATF would not. The Kyoto is currently one of the most powerful ships used by the Terran military. It bears a close resemblance to the Osaka, but numerous upgrades and improvements to the internal structure have allowed for better combat performance at no additional expense. A surprisingly large amount of internal systems are run by software without human supervision, a mark that separates this ship from its ATF counterparts.</t>
	
    <!-- I -->
    <t id="20263">{9,508}</t>
    <t id="20264">This powerful destroyer has not been seen anywhere before. It closely follows the standard Xenon design principles, and appears to be an on-demand response to the new developments in the super-heavy destroyer field. The exact power and threat levels of this ship are not known, but it is advised to run as far away as possible at the first sight of this ship. Like all other Xenon ships, it still has a redundant crew deck, theoretically enabling living creatures to pilot it.</t>

    <!-- Phantom -->
    <t id="20265">Phantom</t>
    <t id="20266">The Phantom is the latest development of the Omicron Lyrae Shipbuilding Inc. Designed to compete for the same market niche as the Hyperion, it combines luxurious interior suites with hardened hull and enforced shield generators, making the ship perfect as a yacht for a wealthy entrepreneur. The vessel has a minimum of armament, but it is able to defend itself from scattered pirate raiders that plague the universe. The current issue still has a number of bugs, but it has been deemed safe for mass market.</t>
	
    <!-- Morrigu -->
    <t id="20267">{17,16831}</t>
    <t id="20268">A rarely sighted ship, the Morrigu is used by wealthy war- and drug lords. Built in unknown shipyards, the Morrigu does not bear any particular resemblance to other established pirate ship design guidelines, implying that the concept was conceived by an independent faction. Nevertheless, the Morrigu has become the carrier of choice for all influential pirates. It is capable of deploying vast numbers of raiders even under heavy fire. Engaging this ship without a determined fleet is considered to be incredible folly, as each Morrigu is usually piloted by skilled tacticians and escorted by several backup vessels.</t>
	
    <!-- Polacca -->
    <t id="20269">{17,16751}</t>
    <t id="20270">The Polacca is one of the first true pirate-built capital ships. Designed around abandoned hulls of MkII Argon Titans, they offer basic functionality at virtually zero expense. Though apparently frail, these ships are, in fact, incredibly robust and tough, capable of withstanding impacts that would rip other ships in half. These ships are often used as the flagships of mediocre pirate clans who can afford a fleet, but are not part of the large syndicates. The design, appearance and specifics of the Polacca certainly make it one of the most distinctive ships available.</t>
	
    <!-- Tepukei -->
    <t id="20271">{17,16741}</t>
    <t id="20272">The Tepukei has been nicknamed the 'Trader's Worst Nightmare'. This frigate is fast and agile enough to chase down most transporters, and packs enough weaponry and shields to annihilate anything short of a rapid response fleet. The design of the ship has obviously been made without any consideration for the manufacturing costs or ruggedness. With a captain's cabin more elaborate than any space station luxury suite, this vessel has been favoured not only by pirates, but by rich mercenaries and trade moguls as well.</t>

    <!-- Raider -->
    <t id="20273">{17,10003}</t>
    <t id="20274">This vessel has been determined to be an interceptor-compliant spaceship. It appears to be a slightly larger, more powerful version of the basic Kha'ak Interceptor. While some sources have suggested that it is an intentional design, a popular theory is that this ship is simply a regular Interceptor that has undergone a slightly longer-than-normal growth stage. This is bolstered by the few recovered hull fragments, which have far greater Nividum density than any other Kha'ak ship.</t>

    <!-- Megalodon -->
    <t id="20275">{17,16511}</t>
    <t id="20276">To counter the potential threat of the Split's heavy destroyer, Queen Menelaus demanded that a new flagship symbolising the military strength of the Kingdom of Boron must be built. As a result, the Megalodon is effectively a more powerful version of the Boron Ray. While it has more armament, shielding and energy, the greatest improvement is a new technology of interior submerging. Normally, Boron ships are filled with regular Ammonium solution maintained at 0.7 atmospheric pressures. The Megalodon uses a special mix of water, helium, ammonium and artificial adrenaline. This makes the crew a lot more responsive to external stimuli, allowing for greatly increased combat ability and accelerated decision-making. As a downside, the humans cite that it is intolerable to listen to long speeches of a Megalodon's crewmember over the communication link due to the extremely high pitch.</t>
	
    <!-- Ocelot -->
    <t id="20277">{17,16651}</t>
    <t id="20278">The Ocelot is a fast, sleek and aggressive luxury cruiser. Initially designed to serve as a fleet coordination and recon corvette, the need for such a vessel in current Split militaristic operations proved infinitely small. In order to avoid losing out on governmental funding, the design team quickly re-modelled the interior to accommodate several luxury suites.</t>
	
    <!-- Tern -->
    <t id="20279">{17,12881}</t>
    <t id="20280">Sensing the need for a new transporter for risky, high-profit situations, the Teladi designed the Tern. Marked as a long-term investment, the Tern was built with an unusual degree of redundancy for a Teladi vessel. A single Tern is estimated to be able to outperform three regular transporters, ensuring that the extra credits spent on each ship would repay themselves in a relatively short amount of time. As the Tern was primarily intended to ferry large high-tech cargo volumes, it soon became a firm favourite of smugglers and illegal ware dealers.</t>
	
    <!-- Geochen -->
    <t id="20281">{17,16551}</t>
    <t id="20282">The Geochen is an unusual ship, a luxury liner designed by a race with very little sense for aesthetics or value for luxury in general. The design and controls were modified for non-Teladi pilots, as even the manufacturers of the Geochen realized that the ship would have little marketability among the Teladi themselves. Even so, the ship is still built on basic Teladi principles, with high shielding and relatively low speed. The huge cargo bay is another bonus, allowing it to take up months of provisions for solitary exile trips.</t>

    <!-- Mani -->
    <t id="20283">{17,16901}</t>
    <t id="20284">With the number of Terran billionaires and space-based entrepreneurs growing, the need for a strictly Terran-designed luxury cruiser was recognized. The Mani is the result, a recent design made to fill the gap in the civil markets. The ship is quite heavily armed and adequately shielded, though the actual luxury has taken a secondary role. Built to impress rather than please, the Mani is the show-off vessel of the jazura, as impractical as it is fashionable.</t>

    <!-- XTC Weapons -->
    <t id="30000">Impulse Ray Emitter</t>
    <t id="30001">The Impulse Ray Emitter is one of the oldest energy based weapons around and is no longer used on ships. No one actually knows when the weapon was first developed. A hand-wielded version has been developed on the Split home planet, and is now sold throughout the black market. Legislations have been put in place to allow the use of IREs on training ships and toys.</t>

    <t id="30002">Repair Laser</t>
    <t id="30003">This weapon produces a fine, focussed beam of superheated protons. The proton beam is used to assist in the welding of new Teladianium Panelling on ships and stations if they need to be repaired. Commonly found on special drones, a modified version has recently been fitted to space suits even though the limited power supply harshly reduces its output. Marines use a more powerful version to cut through ship hulls in boarding attempts.</t>

    <t id="30004">Particle Accelerator Cannon</t>
    <t id="30005">A weapon found in light fighters or used for missile defence. The first iterations of its class were developed by the Paranid and Argon. The subatomic particles are accelerated to a speed faster than most currently known spacecraft can achieve. The particles are then polarised and focused into a tight energy pulse. The particle accelerator cannons have been around since the Xenon conflict and have changed very little since then. Currently, this weapon is the standard of most M5 class ships, against which every other competitive design is measured.</t>

    <t id="30006">Alpha Electro-Magnetic Plasma Cannon</t>
    <t id="30007">A Terran weapon used by both scout and interceptor class ships. It uses powerful EM field generators to propel concentrated plasma bolts at enemies. The weapon was designed first as a theoretical concept for a new type of space propulsion, but the push gained by expelling the plasma bolt was deemed far too miniscule for the energy spent to achieve it. The first EM plasma weapon was created shortly before the re-joining of the Solar system to the gate network, and has been used by the Terran military ever since. The alpha version of the cannon features small heat sinks and a mediocre field generator, thus limiting the weapon's power. It is thought to be slightly weaker than the standardised Particle Accelerator Cannon, but both USC and ATF refuse to incorporate non-Terran technology solutions in their armament.</t>

    <t id="30008">Alpha Neutron Gun</t>
    <t id="30009">A Xenon-developed weapon used on scouts and interceptors. This gun releases bursts of neutron radiation. Neutron radiation is known to be lethal to most biological beings, easily penetrates armour and induces radioactivity in previously stable materials, but it is deflected by most contemporary shields. How the Xenon are able to create their neutron-based weaponry without becoming affected themselves is a mystery. This weapon is relatively slow, but has higher damage per shot. Additionally, the unique properties of contained Neutron radiation induce short-circuits in all engines, temporarily reducing their output by a quarter. While this gun may seem weak on its own, when used as a supplementary armament, it may prove to be extremely efficient.</t>

    <t id="30010">Alpha Kyon Emitter</t>
    <t id="30011">This weapon is of Kha'ak origin. It generates, amplifies and emits kyon particles in a beam. Even after extensive studies scientists still cannot reproduce these weapons, explain how they work or even power them properly. It is believed that the kyons are produced as a by-product of the special power generators used by Kha'ak vessels. These generators are assumed to be of technology similar to the Quantum Subspace Taps found on Jumpgates, though vastly inferior in their power output. It is further believed that these generators are the source of the unique Kha'ak jump technology. Unfortunately, these weapons are incompatible with non-Kha'ak ships. Incidentally, there have been almost no changes to this weapon since it was first seen in action, it has remained exactly as deadly and lethal as it had been before.</t>

    <t id="30012">Mass Driver</t>
    <t id="30013">Developed by the Split, used mainly on interceptors. This weapon consists of a rapid feed multi-barrelled cannon, which is capable of delivering a large number of small projectiles to its target very quickly. Due to the unique nature of this weapon's ammunition, it has almost no effect on a ship's shields, but instead delivers heavy damage directly to the target's hull. It inflicts damage not due to the power of individual projectiles, but because of the large numbers of projectiles delivered. It also causes very little power drain because its ammunition supplies all energy requirements. Because of it's unique nature, no comparison to conventional weapons may be drawn. Be advised, however, that using Mass Drivers is never an acceptable means of 'warning', as the damage it does cannot be regenerated easily.</t>

    <t id="30014">Ion Disruptor</t>
    <t id="30015">This weapon is unlike any other weapon encountered. Developed by Boron scientists, this weapon fires a steady stream of polarized ion particles in the direction of a ship. Then the stream is ignited. The result is a lightning-like effect that affects ship systems and shields, while leaving the hull relatively undamaged. As a side effect, the stream is liable to travel from the target to another object in its proximity. An experienced fighter can link up to ten ships at a time, theoretically extending the range of the weapon up to nine times. Initially designed and a fighter weapon, it is now considered to be a special interceptor weapon.</t>

    <t id="30016">Pulsed Beam Emitter</t>
    <t id="30017">This laser is used by many medium fighters. The Pulsed Beam Emitter uses directed beams of rapidly fired enhanced energy to produce a high accuracy weapon of acceptable firepower. Though the technology is rumoured to be reverse-engineered from Kha'ak beam technology, the researchers behind this concept deny any knowledge of Kha'ak weaponry in general. Each pulse of the weapon's beam consumes a large amount of energy. Even a single Pulsed Beam Emitter is capable of overloading a ship's generator. These weapons can be fitted to interceptor class ships. They are very effective at destroying the shields of fighters, but are rather inefficient against larger targets. As there is no real standard interceptor weapon, the Pulsed Beam Emitter is the closest thing to a universal interceptor gun as one can be.</t>

    <t id="30018">High Energy Plasma Thrower</t>
    <t id="30019">A weapon found in many heavy fighter craft. The radiation is so dangerous that the weapon had to go through many jazuras of research and development until it could be placed on the market. This was worked around by adding a radiation sink into the weapon's main design, which purges the weapon of all excess radiation between shots. The High-Energy Plasma Thrower has been around for a long time, and is now considered to be the standard fighter weapon, off of which new designs are based. It has a reliable damage output, but has no special features beyond the universal compatibility with the majority of fighter class vessels.</t>

    <t id="30020">Meson Blaster</t>
    <t id="30021">An Argon-developed weapon used by heavy fighters, designed to improve upon the High Energy Plasma Thrower. The Meson Blaster utilizes subatomic particles with a short half-life time known as Mesons. These particles are created in the special containment section of the weapon, accelerated on magnetic rails and flung towards the target. The decaying particles create a great amount of localized hard radiation which damages the target. Eventually, the particles cause a decay of the weapon's components themselves, so every Meson Blaster has to undergo routine inspection every ten jazuras.</t>

    <t id="30022">Ion Pulse Generator</t>
    <t id="30023">A Boron weapon used by heavy fighters. In addition to being effective against shields, the Ion Pulse Generator's projectiles give a violent ion burst on reaching maximum range. This can have an effect on ship engines, often causing a reduction in speed. Though based on ion technology, this weapon has remarkably little in common with the Ion Disruptor. The projectiles used in this weapon are small metallic shards that are artificially enriched with ion particles just sezuras before launch. No two shards behave exactly alike once they reach the target due to small variations of the ion particle count that cannot be alleviated. Due to the unique nature of the weapon, it is not effective when used as a primary damage dealer. It is, however, excellent at paralyzing large ships by reducing their speed, thus allowing the real weaponry to target them easier, catch faster, or escape sooner - whichever is necessary.</t>

    <t id="30024">Phased Repeater Gun</t>
    <t id="30025">A Paranid weapon used by heavy fighters. It fires three small charges of superheated helium enclosed in a residual magnetic field. Upon impact with an object, the magnetic field is dissipated and the heat discharged. Designed as a fast firing, light version of the standard HEPT, this weapon has proven itself very effective against fighters. Mostly valued by pilots who have not yet grasped the art of releasing the firing trigger time from time, this laser is best when used as a means to overwhelm the opposition with bullets, without care for where they land.</t>

    <t id="30026">Pulse Disruptor</t>
    <t id="30027">A Split weapon used by heavy fighters. This unique weapon utilizes the natural ability of the Marcus Spacefly to generate vibrations in ship hulls through the use of quantum waves. Passing Spaceflies induce harmless vibrations into ship hulls, often referred to as 'singing' by pilots. The Split found a way to focus and amplify this effect to a point where it disrupts the atomic structure of ship hulls, turning the Pulse Disruptor into a very fearsome weapon. Several dozens of Spaceflies are needed to forge a single weapon, but the exact amount is never completely known. The Boron suspect that in every weapon there are several live or comatose Spaceflies. The weapon has very high damage values, therefore it is suited to Split-like pilots, who prefer every single shot hurting the enemy.</t>

    <t id="30028">Energy Flechette</t>
    <t id="30029">A Teladi weapon used by heavy fighters. It was designed by the Teladi as a cheaper and more effective alternative to the energy-hungry HEPT. It fires bolts of energy designed to damage enemy ships while putting less strain on the ship's generator. The initial Flechette prototypes were inclined to explode, until the Teladi introduced an artificial heat sink in the weapon's design. The current Energy Flechettes are reliable, cheap and sturdy, but still require significant amounts of energy for operation, thus partly reducing the value of their speciality.</t>

    <t id="30030">Beta Electro-Magnetic Plasma Cannon</t>
    <t id="30031">A Terran weapon used by heavy fighter ships. It uses powerful EM field generators to propel concentrated plasma bolts at enemies. This is a more powerful version of the basic Alpha E-MPC, and features large heat sinks and durable magnetic coils. The weapon was designed first as a theoretical concept for a new type of space propulsion, but the push gained by expelling the plasma bolt was deemed far too miniscule for the energy spent to achieve it. The first EM plasma weapon was created shortly before the re-joining of the Solar system to the gate network, and has been used by the Terran military ever since. Compared to the HEPT, this weapon has significantly higher hull damage, but for all other intents, it can be considered an equal.</t>

    <t id="30032">Plasma Burst Generator</t>
    <t id="30033">A Pirate weapon used by heavy fighter craft. Though expensive for privateers, the better-equipped members of more organised pirate gangs are known to use these regularly. Borrowing heavily from fighter engine designs, they essentially spew out a large, fiery stream of plasma, which then rapidly dissipates into space. The weapon is extremely crude and dangerous to both the target and the attacker. Many pilots and mercenaries have claimed that this weapon is 'not fair'. Unfortunately, as there is no single known producer of these weapons, there is no possibility of 'making it fairer'. The pirates who use this weapon have never complained about it's performance.</t>

    <t id="30034">Beta Neutron Gun</t>
    <t id="30035">A Xenon weapon used by heavy fighters. This gun releases bursts of neutron radiation. Neutron radiation is lethal to biological beings, easily penetrates armour and induces radioactivity. How the Xenon are able to create their neutron-based weaponry without becoming affected themselves is a mystery. This is the more powerful version of the ANG. Unlike the alpha version, this weapon is used as a primary damage dealer. Unfortunately, the ability to reduce target speed has been lost in the damage amplification, so the both versions work best when used together.</t>

    <t id="30036">Beta Kyon Emitter</t>
    <t id="30037">This weapon is of Kha'ak origin. It generates, amplifies and emits kyon particles in a beam. Even after extensive studies scientists still cannot reproduce these weapons, explain how they work or even power them properly. It is believed that the kyons are produced as a by-product of the special power generators used by Kha'ak vessels. These generators are assumed to be of technology similar to the Quantum Subspace Taps found on Jumpgates, though vastly inferior in their power output. It is further believed that these generators are the source of the unique Kha'ak jump technology. Unfortunately, these weapons are incompatible with non Kha'ak ships. This version is more powerful than the Alpha version, and it is most commonly found on Kha'ak ships.</t>

    <t id="30038">Lasertower Weapon</t>
    <t id="30039">This weapon is mainly used in Lasertowers, as its main energy system makes this weapon incompatible with ship systems. Argon scientists first developed this weapon by accident when experimenting with a photon-enhanced gamma radiation metal cutter, which created a beam laser.</t>

    <t id="30040">Tractor Beam</t>
    <t id="30041">The Tractor Beam is primarily designed to move stations without the need for large and clumsy grappling systems. The beam uses a series of projected gravitic fields, which in effect reduce the mass of the object, making it easier to move. Earlier versions of the Tractor Beam were not properly calibrated, a production error which made it nearly impossible to retain an exact position of the object pulled. All recent models have been modified to fix this error.</t>

    <t id="30042">Heavy Mass Driver</t>
    <t id="30043">This weapon is a bigger, more powerful version of the Mass Driver, still in development. The research crew working on this project nicknamed it 'The Reaper'. It uses bigger, more powerful ammunition and delivers a good punch, but the size and energy requirements of the weapon are scaled accordingly. Special gravitic shields are being developed that could deflect even mass driver bullets, but they are jazuras away from even a successful prototype - so for now, this remains an extremely effective weapon.</t>

    <t id="30044">Heavy Ion Disruptor</t>
    <t id="30045">This new weapon is a more powerful version of the Ion Disruptor. No one knows exactly who developed this heavy version, but rumour has it that a certain pirate clan developed it for bringing down shields in boarding operations against larger targets. The weapon itself is remarkably simple; it is essentially an Ion Disruptor, made with details that are all 50 percent larger than their original counterparts.</t>

    <t id="30046">Concussion Impulse Generator</t>
    <t id="30047">A weapon used by corvettes which uses advanced and rather inexplicable technology to create powerful ripples in subspace. These bursts are strong enough to physically move objects and the high energy levels can drain shielding and cause moderate structural damage. Even though the weapon does not fire traditional projectiles, the ripple launched from the barrel can be seen due to an optical illusion imposed on local space. The weapon is not particularly efficient or powerful, but as a working concept for a wholly new technology, it has been very successful. By now, it has become the standard armament of most corvettes, able to deal with both fighters and frigates with certain efficiency.</t>

    <t id="30048">Photon Maser Cannon</t>
    <t id="30049">An Argon weapon used by corvettes, also known as the Phaser Cannon. This weapon is the little brother of the PPC. Through stimulated emission and amplification of photons, a pulse of radiation is created which is then flung at the target. Unlike the aged Photon Pulse Cannon, the Photon Maser Cannon imbues each projectile with a limited amount of surplus energy, which helps to create a more powerful explosion. Initially designed to replace the PPC entirely, early testing revealed that a PMC sized as a PPC was potentially harmful to the gunnery crew of a ship. The only solution was to scale the weapon down to reduce the harmful effects. Even so, a special screen has to be installed on every hardpoint that boasts the PMC.</t>

    <t id="30050">Ion Beam Cannon</t>
    <t id="30051">A Boron weapon used by corvettes; a cross-breed between the IPG and ID technology. The violent ion bursts are fired in rapid succession while being ignited, resulting in a constant beam. Unlike the ID, the IBC does not have the ability to travel from ship to ship, but the increased range and accuracy more than make up for it. It is still not certain whether this weapon is an improvement or merely a demonstration of possible advances in ion weaponry.</t>

    <t id="30052">Proton Burst Cannon</t>
    <t id="30053">A Paranid weapon used by corvettes; by firing three focussed proton beams into a special reaction chamber this weapon creates a superheated, gravitically elongated proton burst. A proton burst contained as a beam is known to cut through the thickest of hulls within sezuras and is sometimes used in production to break down older hulls for recycling. The Proton Burst Cannon has steep energy requirements, and the implementation as a ship-mounted weapon has yet to be fully polished. Even so, it still is a powerful, if wasteful, weapon. It is best used in turrets as a means of quickly assaulting several fighters of a wing, diverting them from their primary target.</t>

    <t id="30054">Scram Cannon</t>
    <t id="30055">A Split weapon used by corvettes. The Scram Cannon is a kinetic energy weapon based on ram accelerator technology. Its barrel is filled with a mixture of combustible gasses which are ignited by the ram jet core shaped projectile when fired, allowing the projectile to accelerate in the tube under jet propulsion. Due to its high muzzle velocity, the weapon's output power is comparable to railgun technology while using only a very basic mechanical design. Each projectile comes with its own chemical propellant and combustible gasses. This weapon is normally seen in a Gatling gun configuration to counter the fire delay caused by filling the barrel with gasses before each shot.</t>

    <t id="30056">Bolt Autocannon</t>
    <t id="30057">A Teladi weapon used by corvettes; it was designed by the Teladi as an ammo-based alternative to the energy-hungry CIG. It fires specially designed bolts of hardened Teladianium in order to damage enemy ships. Combined with its high rate of fire, this weapon is as effective as any energy- or plasma based weapon system of comparable size. Most of the energy used by this weapon comes packaged with the ammunition cartridges, putting even less strain on the ship's generator.</t>

    <t id="30058">Gamma Electro-Magnetic Plasma Cannon</t>
    <t id="30059">A Terran weapon used by corvettes; it uses powerful EM field generators to propel concentrated plasma bolts at enemies. The weapon was designed first as a theoretical concept for a new type of space propulsion, but the push gained by expelling the plasma bolt was deemed far too miniscule for the energy spent to achieve it. The first EM plasma weapon was created shortly before the re-joining of the Solar system to the gate network, and has been used by the Terran military ever since. This is the most powerful version of the Electro-Magnetic Plasma Cannon technology.</t>

    <t id="30060">Fragmentation Bomb Launcher</t>
    <t id="30061">A Pirate weapon used by corvettes. The Fragmentation Bomb Launcher was originally created by the Paranid as an anti-fighter weapon that causes more damage with fewer shots. However, it never reached production stages as the concept behind it was flawed. A pirate clan got hold of the original designs and modified them to suit their needs. This weapon releases an unstable projectile that explodes on impact.</t>

    <t id="30062">Neutron Pulse Generator</t>
    <t id="30063">A Xenon weapon used by corvettes. This gun releases large bursts of contained neutron radiation. Neutron radiation is lethal to biological beings, easily penetrates armour and induces radioactivity, but the ill effects are countered by most commonly used shields. This is the Xenon weapon of choice to cleanse planets of biological contamination. It was previously thought that no ship could be able to carry mounted neutron radiation weapons of this size.</t>

    <t id="30064">Alpha Flak</t>
    <t id="30065">The Alpha Flak fires bursts of explosive shrapnel into space that explode after a certain duration, acting as a defence barrier that stops most missiles and fighters. The weapon relies on the large radius of explosion and rapid rate of fire instead of precision. Every Flak gun carries imbedded ammunition cartridges that are good for ten jazuras of field service, or four mazuras of non-stop fire. After the cartridges have run out, the weapon itself is too worn-out to be of any further use. Given its wide-spread compatibility, it is considered to be the standard of frigate anti-fighter solutions.</t>

    <t id="30066">Phased Shockwave Generator</t>
    <t id="30067">A Paranid weapon. Originally developed by the Teladi and Paranid, the PSG has since been improved by the Paranid to be a powerful capital ship weapon, extremely useful for defending against multiple fighter targets. It works by sending out a compressed gravitation package, which reacts and expands, creating shockwaves of phased energy. After several incidents leading to damage of profits, the Teladi banned the use of Phased Shockwave Generators on their ships, making it a weapon unique to Paranid ships. Currently, it has been modified to be a suitable alternative to the alpha flak.</t>

    <t id="30068">Starburst Shockwave Cannon</t>
    <t id="30069">A Terran anti-fighter weapon. Commonly used by United Space Command frigates and capital ships, the Starburst Shockwave Cannon is an advanced, energy-based version of the rather basic flak weapons used by other races. A projectile is fired outwards and once it reaches its maximum range, it activates and sends powerful energy waves outwards, damaging any and all nearby ships.</t>

    <t id="30070">Polaron Emitter</t>
    <t id="30071">A Xenon anti-fighter weapon. Polaron radiation is extremely harmful to biological beings, but can be countered by ship shields. It is unclear how the Xenon managed to develop polaron weaponry of such scale and power without severely damaging their own systems. Remote observations have determined that this weapon is far more efficient that any flak-based weaponry used by other races.</t>

    <t id="30072">Mobile Drilling System</t>
    <t id="30073">The Mobile Drilling System accelerates and emits small, fast rotating helical particles which drill into rock and use supersonic resonance to break up the minerals along existing fracture lines. Its effectiveness against other materials or energetic shields is very low.</t>

    <t id="30074">Tachyon Cannon</t>
    <t id="30075">A weapon used by frigates; it generates, slows down and rectifies superluminar particles known as tachyons which are then flung towards the target. Once these particles are decelerated, their damage potential increases whilst they are decaying. The exact deceleration process of the tachyons was discovered by accident and was never fully understood. Tests indicate that the process does not cause any residual harm to living beings or matter in general. The cheap costs of production have made this weapon into a universally-accepted standard as far as frigate armaments go.</t>

    <t id="30076">Tetryon Pulse Launcher</t>
    <t id="30077">An Argon weapon used by frigates which creates a highly charged pulse of subatomic particles known as tetryons. The particles are contained within a residual magnetic field and are launched by inducing a temporal shift in the surrounding EM field. The upper speed of a projectile is artificially limited to manageable levels, as any further acceleration of the projectile could potentially rip the weapon itself apart.</t>

    <t id="30078">Ion Shard Railgun</t>
    <t id="30079">A Boron weapon used by frigates. The Ion Shard Railgun fires ionised 'shards' of superheated plasma, which are then accelerated to high speed using railgun technology. This combination can wreak havoc on weapon systems.</t>

    <t id="30080">Phase Missile Launcher</t>
    <t id="30081">A Paranid weapon used by frigates. Applying cloaking and transporter device technology, this weapon fires powerful dumbfire missiles which, while travelling, are undetectable by gravidar and cannot be intercepted by weapon fire or anti-missile systems. Upon launch, these dumbfire missiles are partially shifted into hyperspace which shields them from detection and destruction until they reach their target, falling back into normal space, an action which triggers immediate detonation. Cloaking is not perfect though, as the missiles can be optically recognized as moving shadows while travelling.</t>

    <t id="30082">Meteor Cannon</t>
    <t id="30083">A Split weapon used by frigates. The Meteor Cannon fires chunks of rocks broken down from ore asteroids using Gauss Cannon technology. As the efficiency of this weapon type largely depends on the magnetic properties of the projectiles - which vary greatly in the used ammunition - this weapon is naturally not as powerful as the Gauss Cannon. By using a large array of scanners and some complex algorithms to compensate for the property fluctuations of the projectile, the Meteor Cannon is still able to achieve some impressive results whilst seemingly just hurling rocks. It is unknown why the Split opted to create such a complex weapon technology; and even more uncommonly, its inventor dedicated his work to his recently deceased Boron colleague, who died in a tragic space accident.</t>

    <t id="30084">Bolt Railgun</t>
    <t id="30085">A Teladi weapon used by frigates. While the Bolt Autocannon relies on its high rate of fire to produce acceptable performance results, the Bolt Railgun uses bigger bolts and accelerates them to much higher speeds. Most of the energy used by this weapon comes pre-packaged with the ammunition cartridges, putting even less strain on the ship's generator. Often, these Railguns are not properly calibrated, and a shudder is felt throughout the ship as a projectile leaves the rail. Over time, it may lead to structural instability.</t>

    <t id="30086">Matter/Anti-Matter Launcher</t>
    <t id="30087">A Terran weapon used by frigates; it fires a projectile which contains a small amount of anti-matter suspended in an energy field. When the energy field is disrupted by impact or fails after a period of time, the anti-matter mixes with surrounding matter, resulting in a large explosion. This weapon only fires Matter/Anti-Matter Warheads.</t>

    <t id="30088">Incendiary Bomb Launcher</t>
    <t id="30089">A deadly Pirate weapon used on frigates. Unable to easily gain possession of high-tech capital ship weapons, the leading pirate clans designed this as an alternative. This design is based on the principles of the acquired Fragmentation Bomb Launcher technology. The Incendiary Bomb Launcher essentially produces a large ball of fiery plasma, which it then hurls at the target.</t>

    <t id="30090">Polaron Pulse Launcher</t>
    <t id="30091">A deadly Xenon weapon used by frigates. Polaron radiation is extremely harmful to biological beings, but can be deflected by powerful energy shields. How the Xenon were able to create a working polaron emitter of this scale and not fry their own systems is unclear.</t>

    <t id="30092">Gamma Kyon Emitter</t>
    <t id="30093">This weapon is of Kha'ak origin. It generates, amplifies and emits kyon particles in a beam. Even after extensive studies, scientists still cannot reproduce these weapons, explain how they work or even power them properly. It is believed that the kyons are produced as a by-product of the special power generators used by Kha'ak vessels. These generators are assumed to be of technology similar to the Quantum Subspace Taps found on Jumpgates, though vastly inferior in their power output. It is further believed that these generators are the source of the unique Kha'ak jump technology. Unfortunately, these weapons are incompatible with non-Kha'ak ships. This version is more powerful than the Alpha or Beta versions and is most commonly found on Kha'ak capital ships.</t>

    <t id="30094">Beta Flak</t>
    <t id="30095">The Beta Flak fires a small explosive shrapnel package into space, which explodes after a certain duration, acting as a defence barrier that stops most missiles and fighters. Every Flak gun has a single embedded ammunition cartridge that is designed to last up to ten jazuras of field service or four mazuras of continued fire. Once the cartridge is depleted, the weapon itself is too worn-out to be of any further use. This is a more powerful version of the Alpha Flak, and can only be fitted to large capital ships.</t>

    <t id="30096">Photon Pulse Cannon</t>
    <t id="30097">A deadly weapon used by destroyers. First developed by Professor Jo Bydnah of the Argon, the Photon Pulse Cannon became a favourite of the Argon military, who then sold the original designs on to the other races. This type of weapon is extremely powerful. It works by sending highly charged photon radiation through a series of coils that multiplies the charge, creating a very deadly pulse of radiation. Due to its long time of service, it has become the standard armament for capital ships. All newer destroyer weapon designs are based to improve upon the PPC's design is one way or another.</t>

    <t id="30098">Positron Cannon</t>
    <t id="30099">A deadly Argon weapon used by destroyers; it generates and fires blasts of positrons, the antimatter equivalent of electrons. When the positrons collide with electrons, they annihilate each other. This particle annihilation releases great quantities of spontaneous energy. While the weapon principles are very simple, the technology and safety mechanisms used to keep these weapons from backfiring when under heavy enemy fire makes them extremely complex and difficult to produce.</t>

    <t id="30100">Ion Cannon</t>
    <t id="30101">A deadly Boron weapon used by destroyers. Upscaling the Ion Pulse Generator technology and taking advantage of the massive energy available on capital ships, the Ion Cannon is the pinnacle of Boron ion weaponry. A huge amount of ion energy is concentrated into a single projectile, which can disrupt a target ship's systems, such as engines and weapons, in addition to causing a large reduction in shield energy.</t>

    <t id="30102">Trans-Phase Cannon</t>
    <t id="30103">A deadly Paranid weapon used by destroyers, which represents the peak of Paranid weapon technology. Based on jumpdrive technology, it fires agglomerations of compressed, hyperkinetic energy. When these come into contact with matter, part of the matter is torn into hyperspace for a few nanosezuras. The structural stress and the released energies when the matter falls back into normal space make this a devastating weapon. Because of the secondary effect, a very bright flash when the matter falls back into normal space, this weapon is also called 'Light Thrower'.</t>

    <t id="30104">Anti-Proton Cannon</t>
    <t id="30105">A deadly Split weapon used by destroyers; it generates and fires blasts of anti-protons, the antimatter equivalent of protons. When the anti-protons collide with protons, they annihilate each other. The particle annihilation releases great quantities of energy. This is the twin brother of the Argon Positron Cannon, the prototype blueprints of which somehow managed to find their way into Split hands. However, as the Split were either unable or unwilling to reproduce the complex safety mechanisms of the original, they came up with a different solution. This weapon uses Anti-Proton Cartridges as ammunition, which are more or less safely manufactured on stations. This weapon is affectionately referred to as BFG by Split captains.</t>

    <t id="30106">Gauss Cannon</t>
    <t id="30107">A deadly Teladi weapon used by destroyers. The Teladi designed this ammo-based low-tech solution in a bid to save money on expensive capital ship energy generators. The Gauss Cannon uses magnetic coils to accelerate large ionised metallic slugs that explode upon impact. This weapon requires specially-made ammunition in order to fire.</t>

    <t id="30108">Point Singularity Projector</t>
    <t id="30109">A deadly Terran weapon used by destroyers; it generates a small, artificial singularity by using a tremendous amount of energy and accelerate it in a set direction. The singularity eventually destabilises, collapses and releases a tremendous amount of energy which expands rapidly outwards, causing massive damage to any nearby ships or stations. As the Point Singularity Projector uses the Quantum Singularity Power Reactor found only on capital Terran ships to generate the artificial singularities, it is incompatible with non-Terran ships.</t>

    <t id="30110">Nova Cannon</t>
    <t id="30111">A deadly Xenon weapon used by destroyers. This weapon hurls balls of ignited plasma extracted from the specifically modified large fusion reactors of the Xenon ships. Once the plasma is ignited, it enters into a nuclear fusion reaction, much like a small-scale version of a sun turning into a nova, which greatly increases its damage potential.</t>

    <t id="30112">Delta Kyon Emitter</t>
    <t id="30113">This weapon is of Kha'ak origin. It generates, amplifies and emits kyon particles in a beam. Even after extensive studies, scientists still cannot reproduce these weapons, explain how they work or even power them properly. It is believed that the kyons are produced as a by-product of the special power generators used by Kha'ak vessels. These generators are assumed to be of technology similar to the Quantum Subspace Taps found on Jumpgates, though vastly inferior in their power output. It is further believed that these generators are the source of the unique Kha'ak jump technology. Unfortunately, these weapons are incompatible with non Kha'ak ships. This is the most powerful version and is found exclusively on Kha'ak capital ships.</t>

    <!-- Mosquito -->
    <t id="32000">{17,2813}</t>
    <t id="32001">The Mosquito missile is a nimble and streamlined heat-seeking projectile, designed to take out fast and agile targets. It is shaped like a lance, with the targeting sensors squeezed together under a sharp point of strengthened artificial diamond, designed to pierce through the hull of its target, effectively doubling the damage inflicted. Due to the small size, the warhead is relatively feeble and does not pose a threat to ships with decent shielding. The heat-tracking protocols have been recently bolstered not to swerve in the direction of the system's sun, making it just as effective as optical targeting systems.</t>
    <!-- Wasp -->
    <t id="32002">{17,2823}</t>
    <t id="32003">The Wasp missile is a fast, yet powerful heat-seeking self-propelled projectile, designed to be employed against enemy interceptors. It is a standard small missile through-and-through, employing only basic technology in a bid to cut down the manufacturing costs. The heat-seeking parameters of the guidance software have been bolstered by a number of upgrades that improve various filtering capabilities, allowing the missile to ignore more than a single sun or friendly capital ship. The Wasp is considered by most pilots to be outdated already, but it still remains a firm favourite in the eyes of mercenaries, who value price to performance ratios above all.</t>	
    <!-- Dragonfly -->
    <t id="32004">{17,2833}</t>
    <t id="32005">The Dragonfly missile was developed with fighter dogfights in mind. It is neither fast nor distinctively agile, but it strikes the perfect balance in terms of speed versus yield, making it the ultimate choice in heavy fighter scrambles. Powered by basic jet thrusters and sporting a cheap, mass-produced warhead, the only significant technology implemented is the improved heat-seeking system that allows the missile to lock onto any ship regardless of its engine filters, hull masks and radar scrambling systems. The software has been augmented to allow for proper performance even under exceptional circumstances, such as the vicinity of a gas giant or a proto-star.</t>
    <!-- Silkworm -->
    <t id="32006">{17,2843}</t>
    <t id="32007">The Silkworm missile is a part of a new range of missiles designed to be used mainly by corvettes. The small size and slim profile of the missile allows it to chase after fast and manoeuvrable ships. A completely new trigger system has been implemented in the Silkworm missile range - a proximity fuse which replaces the antiquated impact detonator. Thanks to various sensors, the missile initiates explosion shortly before coming within 5 meters of its target and uses the short time to swerve at a straight angle to maximise the explosion impact. The technology is still highly experimental, but has so far proven to be reliable.</t>
    <!-- Hornet -->
    <t id="32008">{17,2853}</t>
    <t id="32009">The Hornet missile was developed with the joined efforts of Argon and Terran scientists. Utilising a little-known physical anomaly which could also be described as a contained microscopic field of warped space-time, created by introducing matter and anti-matter under great electromagnetic field pressure, the Hornet is a compact, yet deadly weapon, designed to produce a fierce explosion whilst retaining the ability to be carried by a ship. Due to the relatively small size for the technology involved, the missile boasts only a basic propulsion system that severely limits its speed.</t>

    <!-- Poltergeist -->
    <t id="32012">{17,8343}</t>
    <t id="32013">The Poltergeist missile was developed long before the initial Terran contact with the Commonwealth races. It was intended to be used as a bombardment missile for small vessels in zero-G circumstances. Currently, it is often used by interceptors and scouts as a means to take out drones or other small and agile spacecraft before they even begin a dogfight. The Poltergeist is thought to be in its last jazuras, and is overdue for replacement already. Even so, the Terrans are keeping close control over the distribution of the Poltergeist missile.</t>
    <!-- Spectre -->
    <t id="32014">{17,8333}</t>
    <t id="32015">The Spectre missile was designed to be used by the Terran fighters as a significant extension to their anti-fighter arsenal. The missile is exceptionally expensive to produce, and the only reason the missile is still being manufactured is the obligation of the Hahne-Kedar to the Terran government's new policy. Even so, a careful background check is performed on any non-militaristic purchase attempts of this missile, ensuring that the use of the Spectre remains fully within Terran control.</t>
    <!-- Banshee -->
    <t id="32016">{17,6553}</t>
    <t id="32017">The Banshee MkII is an experimental missile that utilises a new warhead concept. Instead of packing as many explosive matter packages as possible, the Banshee uses a common metal cone, outlined with plastic explosives. When an electrical impulse is sent within a nanosezura from impact, the plastic explosives turn the metallic cone into a liquid, searing mass that is projected directly forward with needle-like precision. Though shields are able to withstand the impact, ship hull literally melts away at impact. If the missile happens to strike at an unshielded cockpit, the pilot of the ship can be presumed dead immediately. Due to this, the Terrans are keeping exceptionally close watch on any Banshee missiles up for sale.</t>
    <!-- Wraith -->
    <t id="32018">{17,8323}</t>
    <t id="32019">Being the first specialized corvette-class missile, the Wraith has received a complete structural overhaul from its first iteration. Outfitted with a twice as large warhead and custom-designed propulsion systems, the new Wraith is twice as wide as a normal fighter missile. Special mini-jets along its hull ensure that it retains at least some manoeuvrability, but despite these improvements, the missile is still relatively slow. The gunners of the Terran military have dubbed this missile the 'Treacle runner', thus perfectly expressing its performance. Even so, the Wraith remains to be a potent and dangerous weapon, and manages to give the Terran corvettes the additional edge against their opponents.</t>
    <!-- Ghoul -->
    <t id="32020">{17,8363}</t>
    <t id="32021">In need of a dedicated anti-frigate missile/torpedo hybrid, the Terran military issued a large government-funded order for a new device to the Hahne-Kedar weapon development facility. After mazuras of failed experiments, tragic explosions and several breakthroughs in relativistic physics, the Ghoul missile Mk I was created. Combining the propulsion system of the Wraith and a down-scaled warhead from the Shadow, this device exceeded all expectations during initial field testing. The prototype was rushed into mass production without any major modifications, and so far there seem to be no problems in tazura-to-tazura use. As long as the Ghoul is built on partial government funding, the price remains competitive - but within a few mazuras, it may well rise six-fold, once it will have to pay for itself fully.</t>

    <t id="32024">Asimov Missile</t>
    <t id="32025">This small and agile missile is of recently-made Xenon design. It has only appeared on battlefields recently, but preliminary scans indicate that this is not an improved copy of Commonwealth missiles, but a completely new conceptual design, devised by the Xenon. The Asimov missile, whose name was gifted upon it by a history fanatic in honour of the great Isaac Asimov, is used by the Xenon as light interceptor missile. It has an anti-matter nano-warhead and a crude impact trigger. This missile is dangerous only in extreme numbers.</t>
    <t id="32026">Bradbury Missile</t>
    <t id="32027">This missile is of recently-made Xenon design. It has only appeared on battlefields recently, but preliminary scans indicate that it is a completely new conceptual design, unlike any Commonwealth missile. The Bradbury, named after the ancient Terran culture hero Ray Douglas Bradbury, is used by the Xenon as a heavy interceptor missile. It features two anti-matter nano-warheads and a basic impact detonator. This missile is deadly to all smaller ships and drones.</t>
    <t id="32028">Clarke Missile</t>
    <t id="32029">This missile is of recently-made Xenon design. It has only appeared on battlefields recently, but preliminary scans indicate that it is a completely new conceptual design, unlike any Commonwealth missile. The Clarke, named after the designation relay implemented in its warheads, known as A.C.C., is used by the Xenon as a basic fighter missile. It features a quad core of nanoscopic anti-matter warheads and an advanced propulsion system. The missile is highly dangerous to all fighters.</t>
    <t id="32030">Darwin Missile</t>
    <t id="32031">The Darwin missile is thought to be an anti-corvette class propelled projectile, used lately by most encountered Xenon fleets. Named after Charles Darwin to show the eventual evolution of Xenon weaponry, this missile is deemed lethal to most spaceships in the sub-capital range. How the Xenon managed to develop such a destructive warhead and manufacture it in great numbers is not known. It is speculated that the rise in weapon manufacturing means that the Xenon have shifted their focus from swarms of small units to fewer numbers of highly specialized, capable task groups in their military manoeuvres. The full abilities and technology of this missile are yet to be determined.</t>
    <t id="32032">Einstein Missile</t>
    <t id="32033">With the emergence of Xenon-controlled frigates and the rise of frigate use in Commonwealth fleets, it was inevitable that the Xenon would devise a specialized missile to counter the new threat. The Einstein, named after one of the most famous Terran scientists of the previous millennia, seems to be very similar to the Commonwealth's redeveloped Hornet, featuring the same propulsion systems and a similar warhead design. The only thing that is vastly different is the tracking system and flight pathfinder, which are completely Xenon-made and don't conform to previously established designs. All pilots are advised to avoid a direct hit from this missile as long as possible.</t>

    <!-- Sting-->
    <t id="32038">{17,4903}</t>
    <t id="32039">The Sting is the smallest missile used by the Kha'ak ships. It is based on crude crystalline semi-biotic technology, but due to its size and low yield, it is dangerous only to interceptors and similarly shielded ships. The Kha'ak are known to use this missile in great numbers as distraction, effectively doubling the size of their swarm. Waves of Sting missiles are also known to be used to hide other missiles of greater potency. The technology behind the Sting missile has been deemed irreproducible.</t>
    <!-- Needle -->
    <t id="32040">{17,4913}</t>
    <t id="32041">The Needle is a basic anti-fighter missile, mostly used by Kha'ak fighters. It is based on crude crystalline semi-biotic technology, featuring numerous microscopic warheads rigged along the propulsion system. The Kha'ak are known to use this missile in close fighter-to-fighter circumstances, as well as launching a limited amount of these in the midst of a barrage of lighter missiles in a bid to overload the enemy's targeting systems. The technology behind the Needle missile has been deemed irreproducible.</t>
    <!-- Thorn -->
    <t id="32042">{17,4923}</t>
    <t id="32043">The Thorn is the heaviest missile used by the Kha'ak forces. It is frequently launched by Kha'ak fighters, and is considered lethal against most corvettes and bombers. It is based on crystalline nano-particles, overlaid by semi-organic tissue. A single Thorn missile carries eight microscopic warheads along its propulsion system. It is rarely used in conjunction with other, lighter missiles, and is relatively rare. The technology behind the Thorn missile has been deemed irreproducible.</t>

    <t id="32048">Blizzard Heavy Missile</t>
	<t id="32049">The Blizzard heavy missile was designed on one of Ringo Moon's specialized weapon research facilities. It is a distinctive Argon design through and through, specifically tailored to be used by bomber class ships. Unlike any normal missiles that have one to four warheads and a simple propulsion system, the Blizzard has its own miniature power generator that allows it to operate at a far greater range than any normal missile. The Blizzard is robust and powerful, whilst also being comparably agile and fast. The cargo compression techniques used in the production of the missile have resulted in an incredible space saving, but have had a detrimental effect on the price and stability of the missile. Even so, the Blizzard heavy missile is a well-rounded weapon, well worth its price.</t>
	<t id="32050">Cyclone Barrage Missile</t>
	<t id="32051">In early testing stages, the Argon missile frigate prototype proved to be extremely vulnerable to enemy fighters. The barrage missiles were the response to this unforeseen threat. An upgrade to the redundant Flail barrage missile, the Cyclone offers greater capability of dealing with enemy fighters with virtually no drawbacks. The technology used in production of the barrage missiles has been adopted from regular swarm-type missile clusters and improved on several aspects to work with missile frigates and coordinate in greater numbers. Currently, no Argon missile frigate is allowed to patrol without at least sixteen Cyclone barrage missiles ready for launch.</t>
	<t id="32052">Typhoon Heavy Torpedo</t>
	<t id="32053">The Typhoon heavy torpedo was designed by the Argon with one thing in mind - the ability of a missile frigate to take down destroyers and carriers from a distance. Though it lies among the most powerful of torpedoes, its small size and compact form allow it to be stocked in great numbers even in the limited space of a missile frigate's cargo compartment. Whilst the individual Typhoon is slow and unyielding, the ability to be launched at full speed from a missile launch tube gives the torpedo a whole new edge in combat situations. Though the field tests of the Typhoon heavy torpedo are still not finished, it has been rushed into service, and so far not failed to deliver.</t>

	<t id="32054">Torrent Heavy Missile</t>
	<t id="32055">The Torrent heavy missile was designed under the supervision of Queen Menelaus herself. It is a logical continuation of the new Boron armament policy, and effectively increases the combat potency of the Marlin bomber. The Torrent is capable of delivering a significant strike against both stations and capital ships. It does not include ion technology in its design, as the guidelines for this missile were almost a direct counterpart of the general concept of the Boron ion weaponry. This is the first missile designed solely by Borons without any help from the other races.</t>
	<t id="32056">Tsunami Barrage Missile</t>
	<t id="32057">The early prototypes of the Tsunami tended to explode upon launch. The Boron scientists then asked for assistance from their Argon partners. After months of redesign, the current Tsunami barrage missile was created. Incorporating both Argon and Boron technology, it is a fairly potent weapon and quite capable of annihilating any enemy fighters that enter the target acquisition range of a Boron missile frigate. In field tests, the missile proved to be virtually unstoppable, thus earning its name: like a Tsunami sweeps away the coastline, the barrage missile will sweep away enemies from scanner range.</t>
	<t id="32058">Maelstrom Heavy Torpedo</t>
	<t id="32059">The Maelstrom heavy torpedo was designed with the missile frigate launch system in mind. As such, the Maelstrom has very modest acceleration and steering, both sacrificed in favour of a larger warhead. This torpedo was designed with only one thing in mind - the capability to repel an immediate Split invasion. The target recognition system of the Maelstrom was specifically modified to recognize the shape of Split capital ships in any circumstances. That does not mean, however, that the torpedo is useless against any other target. All Boron military missile frigates are carrying a significant number of these torpedoes as a precaution.</t>

	<t id="32060">Phalanx Heavy Missile</t>
	<t id="32061">Unwilling to use inferior general-production missiles in their bombers, the Paranid developed the obviously superior Phalanx Heavy Missile as their own alternative for bomber weaponry. Capable of stripping the shields and crushing the hull of both stations and capital ships, the Phalanx is a more than worthy alternative to the Argon Blizzard. This heavy missile boasts three warheads and three targeting sensors in order to keep strictly in line with the Paranid ideology, even if the actual statistical benefit is miniscule. Nevertheless, the Phalanx is undoubtedly the best heavy missile in production - at least according to the Paranid manufacturers.</t>
	<t id="32062">Sarissa Barrage Missile</t>
	<t id="32063">Though the Paranid claim that the Sarissa is a completely genuine Paranid design, it is a well-known fact that the Teladi contributed greatly to the development of the Sarissa Barrage Missile. Initially, the Paranid had not considered developing an anti-fighter missile at all, but the Teladi eventually convinced them that their Phased Shockwave Generators were not the ultimate answer to the threat of enemy fighters. After a few mazuras of rushed development, the Sarissa Barrage Missile was born. Despite its fast production cycle and non-existent field tests, it has proved itself to be a lethal anti-fighter missile.</t>
	<t id="32064">Trebuchet Heavy Torpedo</t>
	<t id="32065">Able to take out enemy capital ships, the Trebuchet Heavy Torpedo is one of the latest and greatest Paranid military developments. Though the initial prototypes were quite literally copies of the discontinued Hammer Heavy Torpedo, numerous improvements and additions have turned the Trebuchet into a distinctly Paranid-like weapon. The hull of the torpedo is triangular, with a modified exhaust and warhead to account for the change in layout. This has become a problem, as the launch tubes are only partially able to let these torpedoes through. There are known cases when a Trebuchet gets stuck in a launch tube and detonates prematurely, but the Paranid designers are denying any such faults. The Trebuchet has already proven itself in combat against pirate warlords, and is used in large numbers in the Paranid military.</t>

	<t id="32066">Naga Heavy Missile</t>
	<t id="32067">The Naga Heavy Missile was designed by the Split to increase the combat effectiveness of their bombers. The missile is based on crude explosive warheads and basic chemical propulsion systems, but given the Split's renowned combat experience, it comes as no surprise that the Naga is completely able to compete and even surpass its counterparts employed by the other Commonwealth races. The Naga missiles are known to detonate from even the slightest of bumps, a fact that has not stopped the Split military from equipping their bombers with these missiles far over the recommended safety limit.</t>
	<t id="32068">Siren Barrage Missile</t>
	<t id="32069">The Siren Barrage Missile was designed to ensure that a single missile frigate can successfully counter a carrier and its fighters. Crude and effective, the Siren missiles were initially designed to be powered by ground spaceflies, a concept backed by all Split military advisors but proven to be illegal much later. Instead, a basic energy cell system was implemented, allowing the Siren to be produced and distributed in large numbers. So far, not a single Siren has been used in real combat circumstances, but preliminary tests ensure that this might be the best anti-fighter missile of them all.</t>
	<t id="32070">Adder Heavy Torpedo</t>
	<t id="32071">The Adder was the very first race-specific heavy torpedo ever produced. The Split were not satisfied with the performance of the Argon-developed Hammer Heavy Torpedo, and plans for the Adder were conceived almost immediately. Just like other Split war devices, the Adder Heavy Torpedo is crude, yet extremely effective. The robust and simple single warhead - single jet system employed means that the Drake is relatively easy to use and manufacture. Unlike most missiles, this torpedo does not come with an advised safety limit, but instead comes with a recommended minimum assured destruction rating, a minimum amount which has to be carried by every single missile frigate of the Split military. Several captains are known to carry spare torpedoes in whatever empty space they can find, including the crew's quarters. So far, only five missile frigates have exploded due to torpedo misuse, an all-time low for the Split.</t>

    <t id="32072">Claw Heavy Missile</t>
	<t id="32073">Essentially a direct copy of the discontinued Tomahawk missile, the Claw Heavy Missile is as basic as it can possibly be. Assembled from different parts that are not always perfectly compatible with each other, the Claw is a business solution first and foremost. Despite the shoddy quality, the performance of a Claw is rather solid, allowing it to compete successfully in the open market. Though inclined towards jams and malfunctions, the Claw is still the primary choice of most semi-legal mercenary companies in Teladi space.</t>
	<t id="32074">Pincer Barrage Missile</t>
	<t id="32075">The Pincer Barrage Missile was conceived by the Teladi shortly after the Paranids released their Sarissa missile plans. As such, it is an almost direct copy, with only minor alterations to the materials used in the hull and navigation systems in a bid to reduce the overall costs without hampering the effectiveness of the missile itself. The Pincer was designed to be used against enemy fighters, but Teladi frigate captains are known to be restrictive in their use of these barrage missiles on the grounds of their being too expensive to waste against petty fighters. Even so, the Pincer has proven itself to be an effective solution in whittling massive swarms of enemy fighters.</t>
	<t id="32076">Talon Heavy Torpedo</t>
	<t id="32077">The Talon Heavy Torpedo was designed as a solution to the maintenance cost problem of the Teladi capital ships. Thought to serve as a formidable alternative to a regular frigate, the Talon Heavy Torpedo is an extremely slow, yet powerful anti-capital projectile. Relatively cheap and durable, the Talon can be seen on all Teladi military missile frigates. It is extremely easy to shoot down, however, but with proper tactical backup, it can be successfully used against any capital targets.</t>

    <t id="32078">Revenant Heavy Missile</t>
	<t id="32079">The Revenant Heavy Missile is a new addition to the Terran weaponry. It was developed at the same time as the Ghost, but by an alternate research facility, the Hahne-Kedar, stationed on Mars. The missile itself is a sleek, yet potent projectile with two independent warheads with individual trigger mechanisms, ensuring that failure in combat circumstances is twice as unlikely as with any other missile. The agility of the missile suffers due to this technology, however, so the Revenant is favoured due to its innovation rather than practicality. The Terrans are keeping close control on the manufacturing and distribution of the Revenant missile.</t>
	<t id="32080">Ghost Barrage Missile</t>
	<t id="32081">The Ghost is a recent upgrade from the discontinued Flail Barrage Missile. It features an improved tracking system, but the warhead and propulsion jet remain unchanged. The Ghost is still a formidable barrage missile, but has yet to gain a large market presence. The missile was named after its innate ability to sneak up to and surprise its target before it even notices the missile's	presence. The Terrans are keeping close control on the manufacturing and distribution of the Ghost Barrage Missile.</t>
	<t id="32082">Phantom Heavy Torpedo</t>
	<t id="32083">The Phantom Heavy Torpedo is arguably the pinnacle of disposable projectile development science. Housing a nanoscopic package of proto-quasar matter in a warhead no larger than a pinhead, the Phantom is capable of taking down any target, no matter the shielding. Though the warhead itself is exceptionally tiny, the volume and expense of additional systems required to maintain it in an inert state have rendered this prototype to be usable only by missile frigates. Expensive, sensitive and incredibly complex, the Phantom Heavy Torpedo is celebrated by theorists and inventors, and scolded by gunnery crews throughout the Terran military.</t>

    <t id="32086">Gibson Barrage Missile</t>
    <t id="32087">This barrage missile is of recently-made Xenon design. It has rarely been seen in action before, but preliminary scans indicate that it is a completely new and innovative technology, far surpassing other missiles of its class. The Gibson, named in the honour of its first known victim, is used by the Xenon capital craft as an anti-fighter barrage missile. Its speed and yield make it deadly to all fighters within the missile's proximity.</t>
    <t id="32088">Heinlein Heavy Torpedo</t>
    <t id="32089">This heavy torpedo is of recently-made Xenon design. Though it has only been seen in a handful of battles, the damage wrought by these extremely massive torpedoes has been nothing short of stellar. Designated as the Heinlein Heavy Torpedo by Terran forces, it has been entered as a top-priority target on all active military capital ships of all races due to its lethality and effectiveness. All captains are advised to take out the Xenon missile frigates before this torpedo has left the launch bay.</t>

    <t id="40052">Yellow {17,40010}</t>
    <t id="40053">Becoming the official dice to the 'Sunshine and Lollypops' track thrust the yellow series briefly into the limelight, the large number of promotional packs manufactured making it one of the more abundant dice on the market. Whilst its basic construction has meant it is yet to gain wide recognition amongst professionals, it is still considered to be fundamental for the collection of a complete set, forming the base of the special dice branch. The highest price received for a yellow series dice on the black market is currently 35,825 credits.</t>
    <t id="40054">Cyan {17,40010}</t>
    <t id="40055">The limited edition cyan fluffy dice are part of the ‘Azure Dicer' game pack. It represents the pinnacle of the standard dice collection and is recognised as the most sophisticated and awe-inspiring die of the standard collection. A firm favourite amongst female dicers after the 3rd Dicer Tournament was won by a female contestant using a standard cyan die. These dice have been known to fetch up to 276,935 credits on the black market.</t>
    <t id="40056">Magenta {17,40010}</t>
    <t id="40057">A long established variation on the basic white fluffy dice concept, the magenta series are rumoured to have magical properties. Unconfirmed reports, from an undisclosed list of top players, confirm that magenta dice are considerably luckier when rolling saving throws compared to the baseline white die. Though this has not been verified by Fluffco Dicer Division certified testers, magenta fluffy dice have experienced a rise in value over the last two seasons after these magical properties were first discovered. The highest price on the black market recorded for a magenta series die currently stands at a magical 95,386 credits.</t>
    <t id="40058">Green {17,40010}</t>
    <t id="40059">This special edition is produced using the latest environmentally friendly production methods and is proven not to harm several notable endangered species. With the soft moss effect green fluffy dice, part of the new Fluffco ECOnomics range, you are guaranteed to become one with nature. So what if you are constantly stuck in your metallic spaceship with only artificial air and food? The green fluffy dice gives you your own micro-ecosystem right in the comfort of your own cockpit!

With these small pets, your green die will never get any greener! Green series dice have been known to fetch up to 99.45 credits on the black market.</t>
    <t id="40060">Red {17,40010}</t>
    <t id="40061">The first coloured dice to be released after the debut of the original white fluffy dice, the red series features an improved aerodynamic design with sharper, cleaner angles. The refined shape is proven to minimise the chance of the infamous infinite indecisiveness stance, a rare occurrence where a fluffy dice stops just on its edge and remains thus without actually scoring a single point. Red series dice have been known to fetch up to 15,205 credits on the black market.</t>
    <t id="40062">Blue {17,40010}</t>
    <t id="40063">The light blue fluffy dice is considered to be perfect for the novice dicer. Designed with soft corners and chewable surface fluff, this is the only dice that is non-toxic and certified to be safe for the offspring of all known species. Numerous safety features help minimize the risk of serious injury during play, but also render the dice unresponsive and hard to manipulate. The dice retains its place in the hearts of many professional dicers who started their careers with this model. Once the blue is mastered, the move to a higher grade model is noticeable, boosting scores by up to a third whilst suffering only a 5% increase in serious injury. Blue series dice have been known to fetch up to 345.98 credits on the black market.</t>
    <t id="40064">White {17,40010}</t>
    <t id="40065">The original and in many dicer eyes still the best, the pioneer of the dicer game. No longer in mass production, the number of white fluffy dice in existence is steadily decreasing due to the condition known as senile pigmentia. This medical condition, which affects almost all white dice, causes the die to gradually fade to grey, significantly reducing the consistency of the die rolls and reducing its inherent value. Sparklingly white dice are considered a rarity. A small number are known to have never been removed from their original hermetically sealed boxes, typically forming the centre piece in special collections. The Fluffco Company has recently released a new line of white dice rebranded as ‘Platinum Dice'. Every thousandth box contains a specially glittered die that is rumoured to have been coated with ground Spacefly wings. Fluffco executives have denied that any Spaceflies were killed making the coating. Original white series dice can still command prices up to 73,905 credits on the black market.</t>
    <t id="40066">Grey {17,40010}</t>
    <t id="40067">Though it is not an official colour, grey dice started to appear shortly after the release of the white series. The reason for this is quite simple; the white dice are known to accumulate small particles of dust in their fluff that decrease their reflective capabilities and turn the appealing white colour into a softer shade of grey. While grey dice are not manufactured, they do often come with the trademark Fluffco hidden gift in the shape of a grey, fuzzy mould. Greys have recently been recognized as a separate series and while Fluffco refuses to enter them into production, they are now part of the official collection set. The highest price on the black market a model of the grey series has achieved is currently -2.60 credits.</t>
    <t id="40068">Black {17,40010}</t>
    <t id="40069">The latest and greatest military technologies have been used to bring you this stealth dice with no visible numbers on its sixteen surfaces. A military issue ultraviolet light ray emitter is needed to see what you have just rolled; these can be purchased separately, but are provided free of charge in the limited edition collector's box set. Fluffco have also released the black fluffy dice as part of their limited edition Secret Agent Tool Box available at numerous retail stores around the universe. The dice is said to improve your stealth rating by ten percent and sleight of hand by a whole five points, making it that much easier to steal your best friend's dice and then slip away unnoticed. The highest price reportedly paid for a stealth dice on the black market currently stands at 599,765 credits.</t>
    <t id="40070">Silver {17,40010}</t>
    <t id="40071">This is the dice of choice for professional businessmen and elite dicers alike. With none of the unnecessary frills of other dice, this is a traditional and solid die which has won awards for its minimalistic styling. Many advanced users choose this die for its enhanced performance, with the likelihood of rolling a good score increased by nearly 0.02%! Top professionals are using the limited edition signed silver die, one hundred of these have been hidden in regular silver dice packages, giving everyone the chance to own one of the rarest dies in the universe at the regular retail price. The silver series dice have been known to command prices up to 489,352 credits on the black market.</t>
    <t id="40072">Pink {17,40010}</t>
    <t id="40073">This special, limited edition twenty sided fluffy dice is a firm favourite amongst veteran collectors and young dicers alike. Although by no means the rarest of the series, pink fluffy dice are considered to be this season's must-have fashion accessory, and as a result are currently the most valuable of all the dice. The Argon President bought a complete set of dice for his daughter and it is widely known that she is only ever seen with her pink dice at public appearances. The attractive colour is achieved by mixing a slightly addictive narcotic herb dust with Narbhk colour slug slime and the purest and freshest spring water sourced from an exclusive spring in the vicinity of the Teladi Fluffco factory. Notable examples of the bonuses found in the pink edition fluff include an increased resistance to Narbhk slugs, which builds up with prolonged exposure, and for the budding chemist or narcotics dealer, small extracts of herbal plant root. Recently, a well maintained pink fluffy dice fetched the staggering amount of 843,999 credits on the black market.</t>
    <t id="40074">Brown {17,40010}</t>
    <t id="40075">Universally recognized as one of the biggest failures in the consumer accessory market, the brown series is the most common Fluffco dice in existence. Though almost indestructible and extremely reliable, 'the brownies', as they are commonly called, are the most unappealing dice in the whole set. Fluffco recommends that you keep at least one brownie with you at all times to act as a decoy and mask your other dice. The brown fluffy dice is still a basic component of the complete set and for this reason alone retains a value, selling for 3.14159265 credits on the black market.</t>
    <t id="40076">Orange {17,40010}</t>
    <t id="40077">Designed to be the next evolution of dice and the natural successor to the technologically advanced red series, the pursuit of the perfect dice shape bred weaknesses in other facets of the orange die's construction. Notably, the improved shape introduced structural faults that significantly increased the likelihood of the dreaded ‘Crash on Desk' syndrome; a complete disintegration of the die during an intense series of throws. Orange series dice have been known to fetch up to 2,500 credits on the black market.</t>

    <t id="1030204">An uncharted Xenon Sector. All attempts to map this region of space have failed, all scout drones have been meticulously destroyed within sezuras of entering the sector. A single successful scan of the sector has revealed that it is heavily guarded and contains a massive ship assembly. Tactical strikes against this sector are not advised, as the success chance is estimated to be at 0.1 percent. Despite the heavy security, this does not appear to be a Xenon homeworld, suggesting a further fortification with a secure access.</t>

    <t id="1030303">A remote Xenon-controlled sector, uncovered by a stray “Bloodhound #faecd-8xx” drone. The security of this sector is relatively lax, suggesting that this area is not of immediate priority to the Xenon. The ionosphere of the nearest planet suggests that a highly radioactive weapon was used in its vicinity. The local asteroid field is also seeded with scorch marks and burn patterns that suggest a massive explosion in the area a few jazuras ago. A theory claims that a powerful enough blast in close proximity can re-arrange the crystalline pattern of the minerals, yielding new, ultra-hard composites. It is therefore probable that the Xenon used a shaped detonation charge to obtain vast quantities of naturally hardened ore and hypersilicon.</t>
    <t id="1030304">This is a heavily guarded Xenon sector; mapped by “Bloodhound #faecd-852” drone, part of the stray scout drone cluster #faecd-8 that were the first units to successfully map the Xenon sectors. Security is tight, but there is no data on key infrastructure in near space, suggesting that this is only a gateway zone, acting as a buffer for a bigger installation.</t>

    <t id="1030310">This sector was uncovered recently with the activation of the automated "Bloodhound" drones. Built with a highly sensitive gravitational sensor array and an experimental auto-focus relay that allows the drones to lock on unknown gates, the drone swarm has uncovered several new sectors. They have been mapped by the races and can be used for flight, but no safety is guaranteed in these ownerless sectors.</t>
    <t id="1030311">As the most recent of discoveries during the latest Split expansion, this sector currently has very low population levels and underdeveloped production. Security is lax here, but due to the low number of inhabitants, no significant criminal activities have been registered. The settlers have only recently begun construction of a city on the small, rocky moon that orbits the noxious gas giant, and so far have not found any signs of life or alien technology. It is assumed that this sector was only recently added to the gate network during the last rearrangement of the gate network.</t>
    <t id="1030312">Despite the disadvantages provided by the highly toxic planets, the lesser Split clan Rjjt has overtaken the sector under the supervision of the family Zrt and already set up a shipyard and an equipment dock, with long-term plans of continued expansion. The planets themselves are considered uninhabitable, with high amounts of gamma-radiation originating from one of the two. Long range scans indicate that the irradiated planet has had advanced infrastructure and fission-based power, but no life signs or activity has been registered. It is speculated that the species that originally inhabited the planet have moved to other sectors or become extinct; so far there have been no discoveries that would allude to whether they were a new race or remains of a former Terran colony.</t>
    <!-- <t id="1030313">12 / 02</t> -->
    <t id="1030314">Originally claimed by a sub-clan of family Zrt, the Rhwyk clan leaders decided to disembark for the rule of the Zrt and establish themselves as a family. While submitting the appeal to the Patriarch, the data got leaked and ended up in the Espionage Office of family Zrt. Furious that their obedient servants had turned on them and refused to give up a planet that by all Split laws belonged to family Zrt, they invaded the sector with a fleet of ten destroyers and proceeded to destroy all of the Rhwyk ships. The remaining Rhwyk ships jumped to the nearest known empty sector and, officially disembarked from the family Zrt, claimed it for themselves. Unfortunately, the Patriarch did not grant the Rhwyk a right to call themselves a family, perhaps fearing to turn more leading families against him, but did order the Zrt fleet to stop the pursuit. Now the Zrt have built a shipyard in the sector and are maintaining a constant fleet presence in case of a counterattack from the exiled Rhwyk clan.</t>
    <t id="1030315">With the local sun Rhokka just barely rising below the planet Thramka I, which in turn is orbited by the moon Thram'rughet, the sector provides the most beautiful vista seen in Split sectors. Home of the head of family Zrt, the sector is of great strategic importance. Secluded and remote, it offers the perfect location for the most influential of the Split outcast families. A new corporation, backed by the Patriarchate is rumoured to be settled on the distant Thramka II, but has not unveiled itself officially. Being an industrial and bureaucratic centre, Thramka I is undergoing concentrated colonization and development, funded by the private treasury of the family Zrt, who have already sold two of their sectors in the Commonwealth to the family Njy, seeking to cut all ties and eventually become fully independent from the rule of the Patriarch. With a lot of resources invested, the family Zrt is keeping tight control over the sector and allowing few outsiders to settle here.</t>
    <t id="1030316">The sector was originally taken by the lesser Split clan Rhwyk in hopes that with their own sector, the Patriarch would promote them to the status of a full family. However, this was not the case, and the Rhwyk, having spent all their credits on this single sector, have now been sent in a full exile after trying to occupy the home sector of the powerful family Zrt. With rich asteroid fields and pleasant, tempered planets at their disposal, the Rhwyk still have all chances to flourish and return stronger than before, but only if they openly show support and loyalty to the Patriarch Rhonkar. Until that time, the clan lies low and builds up its strength in secrecy, temporarily allowing any ships to traverse their sector in order to avoid gaining new enemies.</t>

    <t id="1030402">This sector was mapped when a “Bloodhound #faecd-8xd” drone managed to survive against all odds and attach itself to a bypassing Xenon corvette. Detailed scans have revealed that this sector is used for Xenon ship system and weapon calibration. A number of experimental weapon tests were monitored in the immediate vicinity of the South gate.</t>
    <t id="1030403">Discovered by the “Bloodhound #faecd-8b2” drone, this sector is estimated to be central node of the Xenon network in this region of the universe. A large ship assembly constantly active in nearby sectors and consumes as much power as a whole planet-side industry. An extremely large number of Xenon warships patrol this sector. An unspecified Xenon CPU-ship is rumoured to be somewhere in the system, supervising the local Xenon network nodes.</t>
    <t id="1030404">This Xenon-controlled sector experiences heavy traffic. With a ship assembly placed on a nearby moon, new patrol ships constantly traverse this sector. Apparently, the Xenon have ceased expanding in the immediate vicinity, relegating this sector to an efficient and peaceful existence. The massive asteroid swarm is plagued with small metallic objects freely floating amidst the rocks. They appear to be of early Xenon origin, suggesting that the Xenon had been in this area of space for more than 500 jazuras. None of these particles show any kind of electric or magnetic activity, but active surveillance units and proto-cores are still thought to be hidden in the field.</t>
    <t id="1030405">Sector was recently discovered by a "Bloodhound" drone. The system's moon is thought to have fractured due to an impact with a comet. No detailed scans of the system have been made.</t>
    <!-- <t id="1030406">05 / 03</t> -->
    <t id="1030407">Sector was recently discovered by a "Bloodhound" drone. The small nebula near the planet is actually a large ion storm, capable of disrupting any electric systems in the vicinity. Due to the unpredictability of the direction of the storm's advance, the sector is deemed uninhabitable.</t>
    <!-- <t id="1030408">07 / 03</t> -->
    <t id="1030409">Recently discovered empty sector. The "Bloodhound" drone had a malfunction a few sezuras after entering the sector. It has been lost ever since, presumed to have suffered an impact with a micrometeorite.</t>
    <t id="1030410">Another sector discovered by the automated "Bloodhound" drone network. It is not owned by anyone yet, and no plans have been put forward in terms of colonization of the sector.</t>
    <!-- <t id="1030411">10 / 03</t> -->
    <t id="1030412">This whole sector is dominated by the face of the monstrous planet named Dnack. Fertile, inhabited by wildlife and colonized by the lesser clan Ngtt, one of the main supporters of the family Zrt, the planet is three times as large as Argon Prime and capable of housing billions of inhabitants. The only way such a giant could have maintained life is due to the intense radiation emitted by the massive sun Dnack'Gzzt, which provides all plants with solar energy far surpassing normal levels. The indigenous life forms have not yet advanced to full sentience and are driven by pure instincts, but because of the huge landmass at their disposition, the species of Dnack average in height at about 15 feet and are extremely adept in their predatory ways. The Split have already begun staging wild beast hunts, claiming that the experience is beyond anything accessible back home. On average, only three out of fifty Split return from the hunt alive. It is not clear, however, who is responsible for the deaths of the 47 Split hunters, as even the Dnack beast is unlikely to be so fierce. The surviving Split hunters, when pressed for the fates of their comrades, accused the inquirers of disgracing them and challenged them to a deathmatch.</t>
    <t id="1030413">Newly discovered by the Zrt fleet, this whole system is now under the complete control of the family Zrt. Normal Split laws are not in effect and the word of the Patriarch has no influence on the lone Krimda planetoid, which is surrounded by spectacular mineral rings, instead, all settlers abide the direct rule of the head of family Zrt. Because of the distance to the territories controlled by other races, the Krimda system council has already issued a decree stating that only Split beings are allowed to land on the planet. This may be a result of the fact that Split criminals were chosen to inhabit this system, and they see this as their own planet - a notion family Zrt encourages, having no interest in the barren wastelands that cover the planetoid.</t>
    <t id="1030414">The second planet, Bothralda II, is used as a colony for the exiles of all Split families. Officially protected by the family Zrt, the exiles are left on the planet without any ships and arms, rendering any attempts of escape impossible. While slave labour is discouraged by the liberal family Zrt, the exiles are known to be secretly contracted to work in stations for food and are treated no better than the average slave. Bothralda I houses the planning bureau of family Zrt, and deals with the placement of stations in their territory as well as plans for future expansions.</t>
    <!-- <t id="1030415">14 / 03</t> -->
    <t id="1030416">The huge unnamed gas giant is absorbing most of the fierce radiation emitted by Rhb, the system's only sun, thus saving the outlying sectors in the system from being completely devastated. Originally occupied by the lesser members of family Rhonkar, plans for the development of this sector did not gain support from the Patriarch himself. Now a lawless place, it is teeming with pirates and highly unlikely to be claimed by anyone.</t>
    <t id="1030417">The furthest part of the Rhbzak system, the lone planet is nothing more but a flaming ball of molten rock. Uninhabitable to even the simplest forms of bacteria, this sector was never considered for serious colonization.</t>
    <t id="1030418">No sector map found in database. New uncharted sector registered on galaxy map.</t>

    <t id="1030502">This sector was mapped by the “Bloodhound #faecd-8xd” drone. A large amount of Xenon capital ships keep constant presence in the sector, it is not clear whether they were warships or construction vessels. The current Xenon infrastructure is relatively old and appears to be badly attended.</t>
    <t id="1030503">This sector was mapped by the “Bloodhound #faecd-8xd” drone. The sector does not support any significant infrastructure or power plants. The security of the sector is maintained at all times, however production and industry seem to be dwindling, relegating this sector to a defensive tactical role rather than one of an industrial powerhouse.</t>
    <t id="1030504">Sector has recently been discovered by a "Bloodhound" drone. No detailed scans of the system have been made.</t>
    <t id="1030505">This sector was uncovered recently with the activation of the automated "Bloodhound" drones. Built with a highly sensitive gravitational sensor array and an experimental auto-focus relay that allows for the drones to focus on unknown gates, the drone swarm has uncovered several new sectors. They have been mapped by the races and can be used for flight, but no safety is guaranteed in these owner-less sectors.</t>
    <t id="1030506">With Nemunos Pi-Nol forming a tight binary system together with the larger and lighter Nemunos Gi, this part of the Spectacular Rift system is scarcely populated, the neighbouring planet in the Magnificent Rift sector taking up all the settlers that were originally heading here. Spatially, this is the furthest point of the Kingdom of Boron in the Expansion Region and so far does not appear to hold no significant value. The royal instances are reluctant to give up the control of the sector, saying that this is the point from which further expansion is possible, and losing the sector would mean the loss of a well-established colony and promise for further increase of the Kingdom of Boron.</t>
    <t id="1030507">The core of the Spectacular Rift system, Magnificent Rift, is a heavily technology-focused sector with rich asteroid clusters and strong solar radiation. The blue planet of Reefligola houses the most astonishing underwater Reef ever discovered in the universe. Covering nearly half of the whole planet's seabeds, the reef is the home to nearly two million new species of fish. The first Boron settlers used it as a free hunting range, giving in to the primal urges, but when this became public knowledge, the guilty individuals were exiled from the sector and the whole reef was put under the protection of the royal family. Now, several palaces are being built for the needs of the noble families who have plans to move their whole estates to this planet. The traffic in sector has already risen due to the number of new settlers and an increasing amount of companies are trying to gain permission to establish their headquarters on the planet.</t>
    <t id="1030508">This is a recently unveiled part of the Rift system, and has already become the sector of choice for the training of new recruits of the Boron military. So far, no accidents have happened yet, but a station was nearly destroyed when a young pilot turned the rear section of a Ray straight into the docking clamps of a station. Luckily, repairs went fast and no civilians were hurt. It is not known whether the young pilot was dismissed from the military service or not. The planet itself has several areas that are off limits for all civilians, and they all are secluded underwater and several shrouded mini-domes. What sort of activity is going there is a mystery to all, but seismic activity of the planet has increased by half a percent ever since.</t>
    <t id="1030509">Covered with deep oceans and steep landmasses, the planet Silaninel Gi-Sul is the perfect place for the Boron to reside. Monstrous tides are created by the gravitational fluctuations of the system's sun, causing severe flooding of all coastal regions and formation of tsunami waves reaching up to half a mile in height and half the equator in width. The first annual surfing competition has already been staged and is drawing in large amount of participants and spectators. Due to the incredible width of the wave, the entire population of the colony can ride a single wave. There are already plans to create a living Boron surfer chain when the amount of participants reaches a minimum of 500 million. The Public Relations office of the Kingdom of Boron has proclaimed this natural event to be a celestial sign of the necessity of unification of the Boron race.</t>
    <t id="1030510">With the distance to the seat of government so far away, the inhabitants of Decarta XII have officially asked the Kingdom of Boron to include them in their territory. Neither the Kingdom of Boron nor the Corona Empire, the current official owner of the planets, has responded to this announcement, leaving the Decartians alone in their plight. The sister planet, Decarta VII, has rescinded the plea and officially declared that they are perfectly content to be under the governance of the Corona Empire. Suspicions of trade between pirates and Decartians arose several mazuras ago, as spies have noticed hidden new weaponry on all decartian ships.</t>
    <t id="1030511">Though the planetside population of Borealis I is considerably large, the space lanes are dominated by pirates and corrupt police forces. Here, all traders are just as likely to be helped as attacked, and often the so-called security chooses to help only those who can afford to pay a hefty sum afterwards. No official ties have been made between the secluded Corona Empire and the local pirate clans, but a certain symbiosis between the two has always been suspected. Numerous traders who risked to travel the lanes have reported intense pirate activity, and there have been claims that the asteroids in the sector have been manually moved by pirate frigates to create navigational obstacles and cover for their raids. Only ships of the Corona Empire and the Split families are permitted to land on the planet, all other are provided with false landing vectors, leading to frictional combustion in the atmosphere.</t>
    <t id="1030512">This sector is occupied by the Corona Empire, who have used the favour of the Split Patriarch and the family Scct to establish their own private government here. The main gas giant, Aurealis I, has occupied the majority of the beautiful skyline of Corona Alpha, which houses the Palace of the Emperor, a three-hundred story skyscraper that entails all municipal and government facilities of the Corona Empire. Focused on terrestrial expansion and isolation, the Emperor pays little attention to the space lanes, and the sector, while abundant with mineral resources, has fallen into disrepair and anarchy. Only a few patrols are maintained, and are often reluctant to help a ship not belonging to the Corona Empire. Though an enemy of their friends, the Otana Confederacy is completely neutral to the Corona Empire - no contact is maintained, and no help is ever sent. It is a mystery where the Emperor obtains his admittedly small fleet and armament - the Boron claim that the Patriarch Rhonkar is secretly supplying the weapons, the Split say that the devious Boron are the ones to blame here.</t>
    <!-- <t id="1030513">12 / 04</t> -->
    <t id="1030514">The first of the sectors controlled by the liberal family Zrt, this serves as a control post for any ships crossing the border of the influence of the family Zrt. The planets of the system are both molten and completely uninhabitable. The family Zrt uses the sector as an easily controllable outpost, directly facing their main enemies - the family Scct. The Zrt fleet is maintaining a constant watch on any ships entering the sector, wary of hidden assassination attempts. The family Scct has already tried to destroy the flagship of the Zrt fleet by loading an Elephant with explosives and masking it as a privately contracted station transporter. The blast occurred prematurely, harming only a frigate and a squadron of Mambas, hence a deep investigation has not been carried out and no official ties to family Scct have been established yet.</t>
    <t id="1030515">The furthest system directly under the rule of family Rhonkar, this system now serves as the colony of the clan Kggst, a firm sub-family of the grand family Rhonkar, an administrative centre and helped the Patriarch to monitor the advances of the family Zrt. With a huge gas giant orbited by two inhabited moons, the system is quiet and peaceful, almost detached from the usual quarrels of the families. Gelth I and Gelth II illuminate the sector with a bright light, creating an interesting colour play. The red shine of Gelth I is countered by the piercingly blue radiation of Gelth II, and is said to look exactly like the colour play on a skin of a Split. The Patriarch's influence reaches its limits here, and back in the Commonwealth, this is actually considered to be the border of Split territories in the Expansion Region.</t>
    <t id="1030516">The first part of the Rhbzak system to be claimed and the last abandoned, it still holds strong by itself and actively trades commodities with the neighbouring Split sectors. With much of the harmful radiation of Rhb blocked by the two indistinct shapes in the sky, Rhbmmak IV enjoys mild climates and rich rains, farms and plantations have grown in numbers ever since the first settlement wave and the future of the planet seems rather bright indeed.</t>
    <t id="1030517">Being the most settled planet of the system, RhbLaak has a developed traffic and information highway stretching across all four major cities. The space lanes, however, are nearly abandoned and favoured only by pirates and exiles. The inhabitants of RhbLaak have begun to form a tight community, slowly shutting off all connections to the rest of the universe. They have not kept contact with the inhabitants of other planets in the system for more than a mazura now. Originally named "Rhonkar's Dismissal IV", the government issued a request to all races as part of their very last communication to refer to the sector as Aberon; the reasons for this are still unclear.</t>
    <t id="1030518">The Yirescia planet was settled at a great pace in an effort to out-build the neighbouring colony owned by the DWC Company and large amounts of investments were acquired to fund the rapid development. The joy of future profits was quickly erased when just after two mazuras the small and seemingly harmless moon came into orbit over the largest of the new cities. Heated by the sun and destabilized by the fluctuations in the magnetic field, the crust of the moon's surface slightly moved and a fiery stream of superheated radioactive gases emerged from the moon's core. The radiation was quickly absorbed by the atmosphere of the planet, causing continent-wide surface contamination and severely disrupting the ecosystem. A team of scientists was quickly assembled to determine whether it was a one-off disaster or an occasional event. It turned out that the moon was formed around a comet that had originally been trapped in the planet's gravitational well, and was severely unstable and likely to create a lot more of these eruptions. Foreseeing the high costs of maintaining a colony in such a dangerous environment, most investors immediately vetoed further development and urged the government to withdraw all construction teams. For now, a large shield has been raised over the biggest colony as the settlers are refusing to leave, claiming that they had given up far too much to leave now.</t>
    <t id="1030519">The whole sector is illuminated by the crimson light of the Ngoolosyasos star. While not readily apparent in space, the intrinsic frequency of emitted light is casting ominous deep red shadows on the planet's surface. Visually unappealing and demoralizing, the strange lighting has already driven most of the colonists away. As a result there is fear that even the most hardcore of the Teladi settlers would leave because the system now holds very little promise for profiteering. It may be unrelated to the lighting, but the crime level on the planet has reached levels never before seen on any Teladi settlements. A particularly worrying arrest was made a few mazuras ago, when the police had taken a group of elderly Teladi in custody. After searching their secret hiding place, it turned out that these Teladi criminals were responsible for more than hundred muggings, break-ins and murders. They were originally sentenced to life but managed to bribe the jury and escape punishment entirely. No further reports on their activities have been made in the sector - the authorities claim that they have moved to another planet.</t>

    <t id="1030606">This remote and secluded zone is where the Serroco Confederation supposedly keeps their military forces. Open to all ships, this sector cannot be considered secret but a fair number of captains have said that their sensors have detected weak signatures of high-tech surveillance beams probing their ships at all time in the sector. It is not known whether the Serroco Confederation actually has such equipment and where it may have originated from, but it does give some ground to the rumours that the Terran United Space Command itself is supplying the Confederacy with technologies.</t>
    <t id="1030607">This sector was only recently discovered by the 1st Boron Expansion Fleet. With the discovery of the sector occurring exactly on the tazura the previous Boron monarch, Queen Atreus, passed away, the sector has been dedicated to her memory. The whirling blue planet was named Atreus Ni Gal and will be used as a memorial. Several teams of Boron architects and biogeneticists have been contracted with the order to create an island-sized image of the queen from artificially grown forests and algae colonies. The project is expected to take up to three hundred jazuras and the planet is currently off-limits for everyone.</t>
    <!-- <t id="1030608">07 / 05</t> -->
    <t id="1030609">Upon claiming this system, the Boron found evidence that long ago, a Terran planetary colony had been settled on the planet Narsilagi Li-Ma. Additionally, a number of old Terran wrecks were found in a low orbit, nearly skimming the atmosphere of the planet itself. The young Queen Menelaus, in a bid to try and improve her relations with the Terran government, allowed a new Terran investigatory settlement to be established near the remains of the old colony. Despite the generous gesture, the Terran investigators have yet to disclose any information to the Boron and it is not clear whether they will choose to do so at all. The Boron have issued a request that they must be informed of all discoveries within three mazuras, otherwise the Terran researchers will have to leave. This turn of events has put a strain on the relations between the two races.</t>
    <t id="1030610">The remote single sun, Galapaga Wo-Ni, is casting its light on the multitude of planets in the Galapaga system. Initially baffled by the readings of the long-range scan, Mahi Ma concluded that the sun may have formed minor pulsar-like qualities. It constantly emits periodic pulses in the EM wavelength and has brief periods of intense radiation output. The Boron astronomers think that the reason for this is a super-dense metallic core rotating in the centre of the star, creating a magnetic rotary field that interferes with the solar flares of the superheated plasma that forms the outer layers of the sun. The media responsible for relaying news of the exploration labelled the star as "Message pulse beacon" by mistake, creating quite the chaos in the midst of scientific community. With the mistake fixed long ago, the sector was named to remind the Boron that rushing only leads to errors.</t>
    <t id="1030611">A small outpost of the Otana Confederacy, used mainly as a secondary base of operations. Virtually cut off from all other major race territory and only surrounded by semi-lawless territories, the Otana III is often used by the Royal Otana family to close private deals without the close scrutiny of the Boron and Split governments. Secret weapon developments are rumoured to take place in the sector, but so far no proof has been provided. This sector is favoured by the shady layers of the interstellar community, with lax security and almost no space rules, every being is out for himself here.</t>
    <t id="1030612">The buffer zone of the Otana Concordancy, this system has already come under several attacks and has even survived a siege. Initially claimed by the Boron, the sector was abandoned afterwards due to a shortage of combat capable colony ships. It was soon occupied by the Otana Concordancy, originally a freelance Boron corporation. Now declared a monarchy, they still keep close ties with Boron government, but are not terribly protective and allow all races to pass through uninhibited, except for the members of Split family Scct. Pirate activity has been witnessed in the sector, but does not appear to scare the traders, who use this system as a neutral territory, untouched by the overly-protective laws of the Kingdom of Boron or the frequent freight scans of the Split police. </t>
    <t id="1030613">The new home of the family Scct, Moncerotis I, is currently undergoing full terraforming sequences. The atmosphere is constantly enriched with sulphur fumes and the luscious green forests are being cut down in order to make space for slave camps. Further away from the system's sun than Moncerotis II, the planet enjoys mild temperature fluctuations and almost no seasonal changes. The neighbouring sector is now occupied by the Otana Concordancy, a freelance government strongly supportive of Boron ways and ideals. Several minor battles have already taken place between the Otana Concordancy and the family Scct, and the Boron are suspected to be involved deeply in the conflict. With no signs of weakening on either side, the conflict has come to a stalemate and both sides are currently passive, busy with the task of strengthening their fleets and ground installations. The Scct clan has already issued a new law requesting all male colonists of the Moncerotis system to adhere to a call to arms at the earliest opportunity.</t>
    <t id="1030614">The furthest outpost of the Scct family, this sector was the main battle zone between the Scct and Zrt families. Eager to gain their own ground, the 3rd Zrt Colonial Fleet quickly established themselves in the sector. The Scct fleet entered the sector a few tazuras later after the Zrt fleet had left the sector through another gate and reclaimed the sector for themselves. Furious of this treachery, a Zrt destroyer returned immediately and demanded to relinquish all rights to sector. The spies of the Scct family, who were onboard the Zrt destroyer, responded by rigging the main engines with explosives and detonating them after safely abandoning the doomed ship. Unwilling to sacrifice even more ships, the Zrt released any claim of the sector and established their outpost on the other side of the neighbouring gate. The Scct and the Zrt have both closed deals with the family Rhonkar, and are now both reluctant to invade the other family's territory in fear of facing a combined power of two strong fleets.</t>
    <t id="1030615">A single scorched planet orbits the distant sun Wigoszer. Seeing the planet molten and uninhabitable, the family Zrt took no interest in the sector, leaving it free to be claimed by the family Rhonkar. Now used as a secondary base for the fleet Fists of Rhonkar, this sector serves only as a placeholder for the Split expansion. The planet, Wigos I, seemed to be terraformed, suggesting that at some point the Terraformer fleet, later known as the Xenon, had visited this sector. No wreckage or remains have been found, however, so the previous theory had been admitted to be false, and a new theory has been forwarded claiming that the planet is a young stellar object, only recently evolved from a cloud of swirling gas and dust.</t>
    <t id="1030616">A fiery nebula expands all over the sky of the sector, a sight rare and pleasing to the Split. The planet Gerr-Sthhmi IV has already been anointed to be the new home of the Ghok Deathmatch festival in the Expansion Region. With the visual backdrop so impressive, the festival will be held on transparent anti-grav platforms tilted upside down, to give the impression of the combatants hovering over a flaming endless gap in the vacuum. Though the nearest tournament is still more than a jazura away, tickets have completely sold out , a large share of them are in the property of semi-legal Teladi companies, who plan on reselling them later at ten times the price. With the city of Shrr'Gutal-tan dedicated to the needs of the arena and thousands of Split slaves working on infrastructure, this sector is expected to experience an eventual economic boom in a few jazuras' time. Luxury cruise companies have already marked this sector as a destination of their tours, a promising development that may lead to an unexpected rise of the family Rhonkar's treasury.</t>
    <t id="1030617">This fairly lawless system is owned by the Teladi Distant World Colonization Company, which has chosen to control all their space stations directly and often with various means not permitted by legislation of the Commonwealth races. A lot of credits have been spent to set up the sector - it was initially thought to form a direct route between Split and Teladi sectors, a plan that failed immediately when the Split left the neighbouring system. Now, in a bid to secure at least some shares of the money flow, the DWCC has opened a black market in the system by lifting most taxes and restrictions. As a consequence, this system is now frequented by numerous Pirate clans and though the DWCC has security forces who appear to patrol the sector, they really only show off the latest illegal weapon shipments that are available behind the market stands. </t>
    <t id="1030618">The Teladi based Distant World Colonization Company claimed the sector without much doubt or hesitation. It has been one of their greatest mistakes so far - the main planet of the system is a molten red ball of matter and the other is a swirling gas giant. With both planets unsuited for serious colonization and the sector serving as a border only for the Teladi, all hopes of profit have been dismissed by now. The sector itself has been offered for sale to the main races numerous times now, but so far all of them have refused to take ownership. The DWCC are trying their best to keep themselves alive and working on a positive balance. The numerous tax reductions and almost non-existent freight control as well as fairly fictional security operations have led to an increased pirate trader activity in this and the neighbouring system. The Teladi authorities do not seem bothered about this though. A Teladi police officer, when asked why he tolerated the pirates that often choose to reside nearby, responded that only a fool would choose to pass up such a large market share.</t>
    <t id="1030619">The centrepiece of this sector is the massive giant planet Gisaloyusos, unique in that it is entirely liquid down to its very core, which in itself is a small, incredibly dense ball of matter with a diameter of only thousand kilometres. The topmost layer of atmosphere is constantly leaking into space due to the extreme acceleration of the gaseous molecules that are superheated by the solar radiation. This has resulted in several flaming streams of plasma moving directly outwards in random directions. One such stream hit the third settler transporter - a unique blend of two Albatrosses and a redundant Phoenix hull. A normal ship would have survived the fiery blast, but this dodgy construction could not bear the stress and broke into three parts with all the content of the cargo hold being sucked directly into the space. A large number of pre-made installations and space factories were burned down even before they had been built and nearly twelve thousand Teladi pioneers died in the event. All of the debris has been collected already and though no part of the construction set had survived, the outskirts of the capital city now feature a unique building complex, seemingly a mesh between a number of space stations and military installations. That complex is twice as large as the actual city, as a result the two have been blended together over the mazuras of extensive development and now form a single entity. The creation has been dubbed "Chasm city" due to the unique layout of the buildings and the impassable gaping chasms stretched between buildings. The network of public transportation consists of a literal network of cables and specialized mobile automatic taxis that use arm-like appendages to navigate the cables.</t>

    <t id="1030705">This sector was uncovered recently with the activation of the automated "Bloodhound" drones. Built with a highly sensitive gravitational sensor array and an experimental auto-focus relay that allows for the drones to focus on unknown gates, the drone swarm has uncovered several new sectors. They have been mapped by the races and can be used for flight, but no safety is guaranteed in these owner-less sectors.</t>
    <t id="1030706">The sector is owned by the wealthy Serroco Confederation. While officially a free government, they keep close ties with the Terran military, a fact that has led to several arguments between them and the neighbouring Argon Federation. The Argons have tried to blackmail Serroco Confederacy ships in front of other races, all of it being merely a ploy to explain a planned invasion and forceful occupation of the sector. It is doubtful that the Argon fleet should actually choose to attack, because it may be considered as an open declaration of war by the Terran government, but individual scuffles between police units and even among bypassing freighters have been said to occur in the sector. While the relations are tense and reports of hostility have been made on both sides, there haven't actually been any real attacks or conflicts and all the supposed hostility is mainly politics and does not reach actual people.</t>
    <t id="1030707">The gates of this sector are situated dangerously close to the thick atmosphere of Ligalos Ton, the second planet of the system. The 1stBoron Expeditionary Fleet's scouts discovered that the atmosphere contains traces of gaseous Nividium, a fact that has raised suspicions all over the scientific community. Only seen as a mineral and never experimentally forced into a gaseous form, Nividium is thought to be a remnant of a bypassing comet's trail. With only a miniscule percentage of it in the atmosphere, it is highly unlikely that industrial grade Nividium processing will be set up. Rich with a number of gaseous metal molecules, the atmosphere literally glows in the sunlight, providing a soft illumination to the whole sector and transferring the daylight for into the normally dark side of the planet.</t>
    <t id="1030708">Another sector where low level gamma radiation was noticed. It emanated from a small monoform slab-shaped device, buried deep in the wasteland of Gilunisala Ga-Ton. The scientists, led by Mahi Ma, uncovered a small depression in the device and connected it to a low-voltage power line. As a result, the device began emitting a series of EM signals, seemingly encoded in an indecipherable language. The main surprise came from the analysis of the material that the device is made out of - it turned out to be an old Terran locator for a spy beacon. No memory chips were found, and the code, even though now known to be in encrypted Terran, has not been deciphered yet. The Terran government did not provide the Boron with any information regarding the beacon, and it is a mystery what it was that the Terrans wanted to spy on in this empty sector. The whole system was thoroughly scanned for more anomalies, but nothing else was found.</t>
    <t id="1030709">The small white moon orbiting the distant, molten planet of Nilapsi Ton-Gul immediately captured the interest of Boron scientists. Eager to learn how the moon had remained untouched while the planet had not, they landed on the moon and immediately picked up signatures of a number of old wreckages. It turned out that the planet had once been colonized by the Terrans, and used as research facility. This did not explain how the planet melted, but something else did: an early model of old Xenon ship, with a broken Xenon sub-processor inside. The memory chips were hard to transcribe, but the Boron did succeed to gain some information. It turned out that a branch of a Terraformer fleet had entered the sector by accident, eager to test a new version of terraforming weapons. Caught unaware, the Terran scientists had no chance of escape. Their automated drones that were on the moon at the moment of the assault captured all intricacies of the attack. Unfortunately, the weapons have evolved significantly since then, and no valuable insights into Xenon technology could be gained from the data.</t>
    <t id="1030710">Upon entering the sector, the 1st Boron Expeditionary Fleet received strong magnetic readouts from the planet Galasa Mi-Na. Eager to explore the source of the anomaly, Mahi Ma landed his ship nearby with two escort ships. Upon approaching the source, the magnetic field distortions grew stronger and stronger, eventually reaching the levels where the crew had to leave all their metallic equipment behind in order to not damage it permanently. Unwilling to admit defeat, Mahi Ma's crew continued onwards, disregarding the fleet admiral's orders. After a few metres, an outburst emanated from the source, knocking out all explorers and killing those who had come closest. With their suits immediately transferring warning signals to the ships in orbit, the captains decided that the team had been ambushed, and, in a very non-Boron manner, proceeded to bombard the anomaly with their missiles. Mahi Ma and the remainder of his crew returned to the ship and ordered that no living beings are to come closer than five miles to the anomaly. Currently, the Boron have settled the opposing hemisphere of the planet and have continued exploring the anomaly with the help of remote controlled drones. They have, so far, been unsuccessful in establishing the origin, age or nature of the anomaly.</t>
    <t id="1030711">With the system's sun being a red giant, the nearest planets have already turned into molten balls of lava. Only a single planet is still habitable, housing small deposits of water underneath the dry crust of the planet's surface. Though hard, life on the colony is still keeping strong. Special devices used to artificially cool the rivers and periodic shipments of ice from the nearest planetoid are made in a desperate effort to cool the planet down. Expected to increase in just a few millennia, the Boron have already begun to implement the foundations for large-scale evacuations of the system grid. Meanwhile, the colony is used as a scientific outpost for the monitoring of the evolution of a red giant.</t>
    <t id="1030712">The home of the throne of Otana Confederacy. Initially a Boron sector, it was bought out by the upcoming Otana Corporation in a desperate bid to secure a position in the Expansion Region. Since then very little has remained of the original corporation, now the Otana Confederacy is an absolute monarchy, built on the example of the Kingdom of Boron. While still supportive of the Boron ways and ideals, the Confederacy is gaining favour with all races and is offering a tax-free lawless area for shady enterprises to establish themselves. Though security is scarcely provided and mainly serves as a show, it is strongly discouraged to attack the Confederacy - they are rumoured to have access to a fleet of Boron warships, mainly used to protect their property from the Split family Scct.</t>
    <t id="1030713">This outpost was established by the family Scct to serve as a safety border ensuring that no hostile forces make it through to their new home on Moncerotis I. Encapsulated in a dense and rich asteroid field, the sector offers both valuable mineral resources and unprecedented tactical advantages. The acquisition of the two sectors in Moncerotis system is now thought to be the greatest achievement of the family Scct, turning them into strong competitors for the seat of the Patriarch. While empty and lacking in appearances, this sector is closely monitored by the Scct Fleet at all times, ready to be defended should any hostiles cross the border.</t>
    <t id="1030714">The sky of the sector is dominated by the twin planets, Ghinn I and Uchan I, named after the two historical Split heroes who assassinated the former head of family Chin. So close that they skim each other's atmospheres, the two planets have left all scientists baffled as to why they haven't collided yet. The Split settlers consider it only to be a matter of time, and are rushing to establish an infrastructure fast enough to let their families witness the catastrophic event from the best viewpoint. The continuous sand storms of Uchan I are constantly raising the sulphur vapours and seeping them in the atmosphere of Ghinn I, causing a rise in the surface temperature and the melting of the polar caps. The Split Ghok Deathmatch fans have described this as "Two opponents choking each other to death, with one of them stabbing the other in the eye for good measure". The family Scct, who are the official owners of the sector, are wary of placing important buildings on the doomed planets, choosing instead to transform Uchan I into a slave colony and prison.</t>
    <t id="1030715">The family Scct upon entering this sector immediately discovered dense metallic remains in the huge debris rings around Y'Irech. They were littered with wreckage of alien ships, some of them vaguely resembling early Terran designs. The family Scct employed several ships to push the wrecks into the atmosphere of the planet, gaining large amounts of metallic vapours and exterminating any evidence of technology they may have found. With the menacing light of Y'Irech Majoris dispersing in the rings, a number of Split colonists consider this sector to be an omen of the nearing end of family Scct.</t>
    <t id="1030716">With the Chin family eliminated, the Fists of Rhonkar were free to claim sectors at their leisure. The unique qualities of the system's sun, Jn'Taur Majoris, immediately captured the interest of family Rhonkar's curbs. With the spectrum of the emitted light matching closely to the iris of regular Split eyes, it creates a calming, debilitating effect on any Split that is not protected from the radiation. The planet Jn'Toris is now used as a preferred place for discussion among the families, and many unfair deals have been made because of the secret influence of the sun. The Teladi have tried to trade one of their sectors for this, sensing an opportunity for unprecedented profits, but have been unsuccessful so far. The population on Jn'Toris and its frozen sibling Jn'Tora is growing at unexpected rates, with a mortality score far lower than on any other Split settlements due to the natural aggression of the Split being countered so effectively.</t>
    <!-- <t id="1030717">16 / 06</t> -->
    <t id="1030718">This is the new home sector of the Teladi Company in the Expansion Region. With a large swamp-laden planet and a high density of organic material in the atmosphere, the planet is perfectly suited to the needs of the Teladi settlers. A notable architectural piece is the two hundred meter wide balance scale, used to symbolically represent the perfect economical situation where the amount of accumulated possessions is balanced with the amount estimated to be acquired in the following jazura. Though not actually representing the current state of the Teladi economy, the scale is held in balance by a perfect micromanagement of air flows that circulate both ends. It is said that the whole scale rests on an iridium needle head with a surface size of ten square nanometres. The impressive structure is situated right in the front of the main office of the Teladi Chamber of Commerce's Expansion Region branch, a notable building in itself, larger than a whole city and entirely responsible for the administrative needs of the whole Teladi race. This is the place responsible for all cuts and decreases in the stock ratings, rises in ware prices and repossession of property and thus is a prime candidate for an assault by the more liberal Teladi individuals. The whole surface is covered with large defence turrets, disruptive systems and missile batteries, and a constant tracking relay is focused on all gates, monitoring all traffic passing through the system. This is the first priority of the Teladi Profit Corps. If anything happens in the sector, the responsible parties are swiftly executed as soon as possible. In the world of Teladi business, losing is not an option and the heavy weapons of the Teladi destroyers are perfect for underlining this philosophy.</t>
    <t id="1030719">The continuous toll of maintaining a rapid-response colonization fleet had taken a lot out of Teladi generals. Upon the discovery of this system, the fleet admiral issued an official protest against the company directors, claiming that they would refuse to move until their salaries would be raised. With the request for more money serving as an effective insult, the fleet was refused its demands and ordered to resume all activities or no credits would be submitted to the bank accounts of the crew at all. The ship officers used the following mazura-long strike to relax themselves and tend to their own personal mini-companies and earning means. After nearly a mazura of standstill, the fleet submitted to the will of the investors and resumed normal operation. Now the sector is developed into a hard-working mining and production industry and the local asteroid field has been opened up completely by the Teladi opportunists. Due to the fact that the whole sector had originated from a passive protest, many other Teladi consider the locals to be a bunch of lazy good-for-nothings, a trend that is seriously harming the annual evaluation of the total productivity of the sector.</t>
    <t id="1030720">This sector is a prime example of the Teladi skill to turn anything into a profit opportunity. The only particularly interesting thing in this system is the nearly unobstructed view to the Andromeda galaxy. Only a single nebula is between the galaxy and the sector, providing astronomers and space-enthusiasts with a perfect chance to explore the intricacies of the galaxy that is an almost identical twin of the Milky Way. The light of the supernovae of Andromeda is clearer from this vantage point and astronomers are able to pinpoint the exact distance between the galaxies at a greater precision. While it is currently still estimated to be far beyond the range of any jumpdrive, the Teladi are financing new developments of the jumpdrive technology out of personal interest in the abundance of rare mineral resources that the other galaxy may hold. Numerous ideas for jumpgate teleportation have been raised, only to be silenced shortly afterwards by the joined effort of sceptics and common sense. A small automated drone, equipped with solar panels, experimental ion drive and a tracking beacon that a jumpdrive can theoretically get a lock on was sent onwards to the Andromeda galaxy. The drone utilizes renewable energy gained from solar panels to power the experimental ion drive and keep constant acceleration. It is also designed to scan the surroundings for any gates and report their locations back to the control centre in the system should it find any.</t>

    <t id="1030801">This appears to be the closest current Xenon outpost in the Expansion Region. Analysis shows that the Xenon have claimed this territory very early, at the period of first expansion into this gate network nearly 800 jazuras ago. Now the Xenon use this as a front for regular raids into nearby deserted territories, but they have not attempted to expand in this direction in the recent mazuras. Curiously, the Xenon have shown no interest in the remnants of the ancient Terran colony on the neighbouring sector's main planet. A number of reports indicate that trace amounts of Nividium may be found near the local asteroid cluster, but none of distant-range mineral scans have revealed a rock of high enough density to boast a significant yield of the rare mineral.</t>
    <t id="1030802">This sector has moderate Xenon activity. There is sign of rapid development on the nearby planets, suggesting a heavy industrial infrastructure, created by the Xenon. All development is focused on efficiency and streamlining; for some unknown reason the Xenon do not appear to be building any new factories or communication nodes.</t>

    <t id="1030806">As the furthest sector belonging to the Argon Federation in the Expansion Region, this system has become a dangerous place for traders to operate in. The Serroco Confederacy ruling the adjacent system is suspected to be behind a number of assaults against Argon ships. However, the Argon government does not feel inclined to station heavy military forces at this frontier in order to not cause unwanted aggression from the independent confederacy. A union of traders has already accused the Confederacy for allowing pirates to use their system as a base of operations.</t>

    <t id="1030810">Revered by Boron scientists, this sector has become a hub of astronomer conventions and research bases. The sky is already illuminated by two bright suns, but a third sun is evolving from a swirling cloud of super-heated gas. It seems to sap material from the two older suns, an advantage it would not have if it weren't situated right in the middle of its two older siblings. The sector itself has a unique asteroid belt, rich in minerals and completely implausible to have been created by natural means. Scientists are sure that such a small cluster of asteroids cannot possibly arrange itself in such a stretched line, but the proof is right here. No traces of tractor beam locks have been found and the Terran science teams have not found any data mentioning the displacement of asteroids anywhere in their old colonies. Currently Boron scientists have forwarded a theory claiming that the asteroids are remains of a cracked moon, but there are no other moons or gravitational anomalies that could have led to this.</t>
    <t id="1030811">Lost among the blackness of the universe, this lone star just barely peeks through the rich atmosphere of Misiilmantea Li-Ton, the system's only planet. With a surface twice as large as that of the Boron home planet, this new colony is expected to boom soon. The planet is estimated to be capable of accommodating up to three billion Borons, but it is feared that the number will be exceeded quickly with the fair number of artists and singers moving here to gain inspiration from the unique vista visible from the orbit.</t>
    <t id="1030812">With both of the planets frozen in their journey through the vastness of space, this system holds little promise for becoming a major settlement. Currently used just for meditation and the "coming of age" ceremony, the single city Mesmarea Ni Ta does not try to provide food for itself. It relies on automated supply lanes from the farms on the other planet, which have been overproducing for half a jazura now. Several Borons have been found frozen solid when their environment suits refused to upkeep the normal warmth during the wozura-long mediation. Several military transports have been seen heading into the neighbouring Otana Concordancy territory, but the Boron have dismissed all claims of weapon trade.</t>

    <t id="1030815">The sector is now owned by the family Rhonkar directly and has already a bloody history despite the shortness of the time elapsed since its discovery. Originally claimed by the family Chin, it was the cause of the great battle between 1st Chin Conqueror Division and 1st Scct Grand Family Fleet. Both sides fought furiously for several tazuras, until only a single Chin Clan ship remained. Seeing the odds were against him, the captain ordered a retreat to the eastern sector, hoping that the Scct attackers would not follow. With only a couple of ships remaining on the Scct side, all of them having suffered serious damage, the Rhonkar family's fleet, "Fists of Rhonkar" moved in and took ownership of the sector, much to the dismay of the family Scct. Now with both Parati I and Parati II heavily populated, this sector is most adjusted to the new situation, and true Split-like coups have already been made by the leading families in an effort to topple the hold of family Rhonkar over the sector.</t>
    <t id="1030816">The first thing the vice-admiral of the single remaining destroyer of the 1st Chin Conqueror Division did was to execute the captain of the ship for ordering a retreat. He proceeded to claim the sector, but his gain was short-lived. Fists of Rhonkar, the grand Split fleet, entered the sector only two tazuras later, with the intention to eliminate any presence of the family Chin from the Expansion Region. Due to an extremely odd coincidence, the Teladi entered the sector from the other side, seeking to explore new territories. The vice-admiral Chin decided that the Teladi had a deal with family Rhonkar and were intending to destroy him. In a desperate flash of rage, he ordered all energy to be diverted to the starboard guns and a full salvo launched at the lead flagship of the Teladi Profit Extension Fleet. The shields of the Phoenix didn't last long, and it disintegrated in a flash at the very same time the Chin's last ship exploded because of weapon systems not being able to bear the increased load. Now owned by the family Rhonkar, this sector is revered by both the Split and the Teladi, and serves as a minor beacon of collaboration between the two races.</t>
    <t id="1030817">The 4th Teladi Profit-Augmentation Fleet suffered a great loss in this sector cluster. After the automated explorer drones had discovered this sector and its neighbour, the fleet jumped in the sector, claimed it and proceeded to the next one. Unfortunately, it was the exact same time when the disgraced and outlawed destroyer owned by the Split family Chin tried to hide from the pursuing forces of the Patriarch. Surprised by the sudden appearance of the Teladi fleet flagship, the Chin destroyer opened full fire on it in a senseless display of power. The flagship was destroyed in mere moments. The rest of the fleet, seeing that any further actions may only lead to loss of more ships, quickly retreated back through the gate. Left without a leading ship and an admiral, the Teladi fleet settled down for some tazuras perform urgent repairs, clear things up with the Split and wait for the arrival of a replacement destroyer. The Teladi claim that the Split Patriarch initially promised to fund the production of a new Phoenix class destroyer, seeing as it was their fault that the Chin destroyer was in the sector, but so far the Teladi Company has not received a single credit from the family Rhonkar. This has led to severe arguments among the members of the Profit guild, with the Paranids siding with the Teladi and demanding that the Split repay the cost of a new Phoenix. While the relations aren't good, trade has not stopped between the two races, as very few things can enrage the Teladi so much that they would refuse the chance to trade.</t>
    <t id="1030818">The twin suns situated at the opposite sides of the system set both sides of the local planets alight. With no actual night to speak of, the Teladi company directors have turned the whole colony into a gigantic labour camp. The work is fragmented in two twelve-stazura shifts, with no actual cessation in the production process. The employees of most industrial plants are kept on the edge by random high-pitched sounds, inclusion of artificial scents and pheromones in the air conditioning systems as well as secretly administered spaceweed and space fuel concentrates in cafeterias. Most of the practices are outlawed even in Teladi territories, but somehow the ruling entrepreneurs of the system have avoided any inspections. The main industrial giants have also been very firm with their tax payments, generating the largest amount of tax money collected per system in the whole Expansion Region. As long as no workers issue complaints about the working conditions, this situation will continue. Given the fact that every settler of the colony has written a special clause saying that they are not allowed to complain about any unsuitable conditions that may arise from the colonization of new planets, there is very little hope that these slave camps will be shut down any time soon.</t>

    <t id="1030906">With both planets undergoing unexpected population growth, local feuds have risen among the settlers, with a small number of them ending up in a comatose state. The Argon government has promised to intervene, should the situation escalate to threatening levels, but this is doubtful due to the myriad of other tasks that now occupy the full attention of the Argon Senate. Without a shipyard of any kind, the inhabitants of Settler's Feud have little hope of surpassing the recent industrial growth of the Sonora, though they do not wish to let the Colonial Senate dismiss their planet as inferior; though the times are hard, the people are proud.</t>

    <t id="1030908">A single terrestrial planet orbiting Pyxis Majoris, the Argon literally struck nividium with the acquisition of the planet. It's unclear how the extremely rare mineral ended up on the surface of the planet. Analysts have concluded that the mineral found on the planet is a new form of nividium alloy, a lot more fragile than the pure substance found in space. With the rich asteroid clusters in orbit, specialists think that the nividium might have originated from a collision of two asteroids in space. A number of entrepreneurs have already set up mines on the richer asteroids in hopes of discovering more of the rare substance. The Teladi NMMC company has already offered to purchase the rights to set up Nividium mines in the sector.</t>
    <t id="1030909">This sector is a planetless binary star system and the border between Argon and Split territories in the Expansion Region. The intense radiation of Piscis Austrinus does nothing to improve the cool relations of the two species, who already have a long history of warfare during the Boron Campaign. The tension is high, but the trade does not stop - gaining an economical foothold in the Expansion Region is the number one priority for most races. With a number of advanced high-tech factories, it is unlikely that the Argons will choose to surrender the sector to the Split.</t>
    <t id="1030910">After back-tracking their way through the Merindasa system, the Boron Expeditionary Fleet claimed this sector in order to establish much needed repair facilities and technology production stations. With only a single inhabitable planet, the local population is facing hard times due to the highly polluted water of the planet. The pollution originates from a known type of algae, which has covered nearly all surface areas of seas and is littering the seabeds underneath with dead leaves, filling the water with a sort of a compost material. Protective biodomes had to be installed, but by now the Boron have had considerable success in clearing the water and re-populating it with species of fish they had taken along. With development moving along nicely, there is the hope that this planet will eventually become fully suited for living.</t>
    <t id="1030911">While not the main sector of the Merindasa system, the Boron could not bear to denote a sector with such a beautiful sight as something secondary. The system's sun is just barely rising above the horizon of the nearest planet, creating a perfect reconstruction of a background used in all Boron space operas. The local asteroid field, seemingly poor in mineral composition, did provide the lead scientist Mahi Ma with the chance for new discoveries - an ancient device, emitting weak gamma radiation, was buried deep within an ore asteroid. The signature and the unidentifiable alloys could not be matched against the technology of any race. The estimated age of the device is more than 900,000 jazuras, a date very close to the estimated age of the jumpgates themselves. It is not known whether this is a technology of the Ancients, the Helpers, or just an artifact of a lesser race, but it has already been delivered to the private residence of the Queen Menelaus in Kingdoms End.</t>
    <t id="1030912">The first inhabited system the Boron found, Merindasa, proved that scientific exploration was a justified cause for the expansion and the deviation from the initial alliance with the Argon fleet. The blue gas giant, Merindasa Ne-Tol, is entirely gaseous down to its core, with the usual layer of liquid metal components completely absent. A research station has already been established near the surface of the giant, encapsulated in a large silicon asteroid for protection against micro-meteorites and upheld by massive engines. The two nearby planets, Merindasa Wo-Ni and Re-Gul, which have now been colonised by the Boron, have also shown a unique lack of any heavy metal elements. With the sector serving as a security buffer of the new property of the Kingdom of Boron, no less than three skilled Lar tacticians are stationed at the outpost at any given time, ready coordinate the actions of the Special Response Fleet, should the need ever arise.</t>

    <t id="1030914">The gate to this sector was discovered only recently, and this is the youngest of the Split conquered sectors in the Expansion Region. The sky is dominated by the glow of the J'Karr nebula, thought to be created by an extremely strong solar flare expulsed by the systems main sun, J'Snrra. Snrra I is the only inhabited planet, and the Split have not forwarded any plans for further acquisition of territories. The claiming of the sector was not as easy, though; the Teladi had already begun to move their ships towards this sector in order to establish an economic outpost when the Patriarch learned of the existence of the sector. Reluctant to give up something that may belong to him, he ordered a single Raptor to split off the fleet and claim the territory behind the gate. A number of relict Terran ship wrecks were found in the sector. Most of them have already been moved by the Terran government, which had a hard time convincing the Split to give the empty carcasses away.</t>
    <t id="1030915">Initially claimed by the disgraced remains of family Chin, who had secretly slipped in their fleet along with family Scct and family Zrt, the sector was quickly established as the base of expansion. Shortly afterwards the Patriarch Rhonkar learned that the family Chin secretly held the territories in the Expansion Region. Enraged, he ordered his personal fleet to invade and reclaim all sectors occupied by family Chin. Now named Rhonkar's Dominion, the sector serves as an example and a warning to other families, a constant reminder that the Patriarch can't be tricked. The system has 6 planets, lit by the C'Akruevu. Only Akruevu II and Akruevu III are inhabited though, as the actual colonization of planets is of low priority to the Split.</t>

    <t id="1030917">The bright sun Kossasylios emits strong radiation over the system's main inhabited planet, Kossasyl I. The Teladi enterprises located on the surface of the planet adhere to a new custom - the workers are all asked to thank the sun each morning for its fierce rays that allows the work to continue tazura by tazura. So far, no proof has been provided that the procedure actually improves the collective output. The lesser sun, Kossasylianes, gives a slight red tint to everything in the sector and has a strong effect on the planet's atmosphere, lighting it in rich crimson colours. The local moon seems to be rich in ice and silicon veins, therefore an industry is being set up on the moon that should provide support for a never-ending stream of transport ships that would ferry the minerals back to the planet-based smelters. The green background is visually pleasing to all Teladi, said to remind the colouring of their hatching grounds. The sector, while not being very prominent or important, is still a firm favourite for the settlers that wish to lead quiet and easy lives enriched by mediocre, but stable profits.</t>
    <t id="1030918">The lone gas giant, encircled by a thick layer of asteroid debris, is a visually stunning spectacle that has given the Teladi investors a fair amount of headache and scale twitching. Initial scans of the rings returned information that trace amounts of pure Ruthenium, Iridium and Desanychlityum had been found among the floating rocks. Seven teams of scouts were sent to zero in on the source of the readings, but none of them had any success on this task. The readings seemed to be too unfocused and new scans resulted in new positions returned as the source. A whole transporter fleet was sent to the sector to try and find the possible mineral deposits. After two wozuras of intense searching, the crew of an Albatross noticed a movement in the left flank. It turned out to be a flock of rock beetles, with their shells being formed out of the rare metals. Over the course of the following mazura, the beetles were traced back to a particular segment of the ring where a whole swarm had found their home. The beetles were hastily captured and killed for easier transportation. Due to a strange biomechanical protection system, the beetles literally disintegrated in the cargo holds, splitting the rare and valuable metals in more common alloys. The net loss of the operation was not really that high since the alloys, while common, were just enough to cover most of the expenses, but the initial funds to start the operation had been taken out of the whole expansion budget, leading to unexpected savings in some other areas, like the lack of proper transporter ships in the nearby Gisaloyusos system.</t>
    <t id="1030919">This sector is illuminated by a unique cluster of four stars - a double binary system. Two star pairs orbit each other while revolving themselves, creating intense gravitational anomalies in the whole sector. No planets are to be found here, since their creation is virtually impossible in such a turbulent gravitational field. The actual location of the sector relative to the centre of the galaxy is constantly fluctuating, rotating spontaneously around the tumbling stars. The gates themselves are in perfect harmony, with every movement matching that of their counterparts within nanometres, but newly built stations have shifted their positions due to badly placed distribution of mass. The most notable example up until now occurred more than a jazura ago, when the trading station ended up directly in front of the docking clamps of a local solar power plant, blocking all traffic. The tractor beams on the corvette sent to fix the situation turned out to be severely malfunctioning due to intense gravitational fluctuations so the station had to be literally pushed away by sheer engine power. Now the placement algorithms have been fine-tuned to reflect the complicated situations in order for no new disasters to occur.</t>

    <t id="1031006">Orbiting the enormous gas giant Sonora Titanis, Sonora II's dark side, which is eternally facing away from the light of Sonos Majoris, is now fully colonized, . With a large shipyard and an equipment dock in orbit along a number of high-tech factories, Sonora is thought to be a prime candidate of the future location of the colonial senate, greatly surpassing their nearest competition. The two lone asteroids have so far resisted all attempts of long range scans, indicating either extremely high mineral density or a presence of unknown alloys.</t>
    <t id="1031007">The star Pictoris is undergoing a period of intense nuclear combustion, emitting severe magnetic fluctuations that may adversly affect ship guidance systems. Foreseeing a chance for profits, the Argon government recently ordered that a wharf to be stationed in the sector to provide any emergency repairs. Along with a strong military presence, this sector is deemed to be the most secure location of the whole Argon territory. The colonization of the planet Gaertner II is going well, with a whole administrative city sprawling under the sky encrusted with no less than three moons.</t>
    <t id="1031008">With only a b-class star in the system it is unclear why power production companies have chose this sector to set up their base of operations. Some maintain the opinion that the sector is in a perfect location logistics wise, surrounded by a number of energy hungry tech factories, while others claim that the executives of power plants ran out of funds and were forced to drop their stations here. The HQ of power management will reside in a large skyscraper on the outskirts of the capital city. Irokawa Prime itself is rich and fertile, with high amounts of water vapours in the atmosphere, leading to an ever increasing number of plantations on the surface. The day/night cycle of this planet is exactly 1 tazura long, a coincidence some claim to be a proof of the existence of higher beings.</t>

    <t id="1031010">With a population score nearing the 100 million mark, this is one of the most heavily settled sectors of the new Boron territory. Originally inhabited by a species named Ghwaark, a vicious sea predator, the Boron had almost dismissed the planet as unworthy for colonization. However, a better solution was found, and a massive barrier has been built surrounding a small region where the beast has been herded. Unwilling to exterminate whole species, the Boron are now planning a full-scale move of the population to nearby uninhabited water planets. By now, the small enclosure has been breached twice already, but fortunately there were no casualties. The other races have expressed their disbelief of the amount of credits required for the repositioning of a whole species. The Boron spokesman said that this is a necessary tribute and the Boron are happy to carry it out all the way to the end.</t>
    <t id="1031011">Eager to discover more cryptic artifacts, the young Queen Menelaus ordered the Expeditionary fleet to move on as soon as possible. Upon entering this sector, another gas giant was found, showing to be twice the density of any gas giant ever encountered. To establish how the stellar object stays gaseous, a special, one of a kind project has begun here. A whole city dedicated to research and probing is being built a few kilometers below the topmost gas layer. Situated right on the edge of two counter wise gas streams, the research centre literally floats in the air, upheld by its buoyancy and special hydro-dynamic fins. The Boron hope to supplement the existing theories of planetary evolution and gravitational impact on matter by the data that the research station will provide.</t>
    <t id="1031012">After the Argon had broken their deal with the 1st Boron Expeditionary Fleet and claimed the first free sector of the Expansion Region, New Horizon, for themselves, the Boron admiral ordered, after consulting lead scientist Mahi Ma, his fleet to change direction and head north. The first sector he uncovered was named after a legendary Boron sea monster, claimed to live beyond the six seas. The large asteroid field now serves as an outpost for the Boron and as a border separating their territory from unwelcome guests. Initially a fair number of Terran ship wrecks were discovered drifting aimlessly among the asteroids; with no signs of combat-induced damage, it is unclear why these ships ended up in such a bad shape. Curiously, no remains of the crew were found.</t>

    <t id="1031015">Located in the depths of the Namira Cloud in the outskirts of the Solara System, the Tortuga base is still considered a legend by most. Initially established by illegally operating miners about 200 jazuras ago, the base was quickly expanded throughout the whole asteroid and became a node for all kinds of semi-legal organisations and groups, often frequented by pirate ships buying supplies for their raids in the cloud. Over the jazuras, the base was expanded more and more by utilizing the minerals mined from the asteroid itself and processed in refineries built on the surface of the rock. At one point, the base was taken over by the 'Black Hand' pirate clan, developing into a full-fledged city with thousands of inhabitants and a hub of all illegal activities in the Solara System under their protection.\nThe opening up of the Solara System three jazuras ago, however, did not have just positive influence on the former 'Lost Colony': With millions of colonists flooding into the Expansion Region, so did the less desirable members of the society. And it wasn't long before the most powerful criminal syndicate of the known universe, the Yaki, set their eyes on Tortuga. Few mazuras later, their influence was so great that they successfully staged a bloody coup d'état and took control over the base, displacing the Black Hand clan from their own base in the process.\nToday Tortuga has been expanded even further and is now the base of operations for most if not all Yaki activities in the Expansion Region.</t>

    <t id="1031017">As the first Teladi foothold in the Expansion Region, the system now is considered to be the greatest hub for stock exchanges and flea markets in the new territories. The planet Atropos I is one gigantic desert, covered entirely in sand dunes and meteor craters. The Teladi have built elaborate underground cities just below the surface and their greatest achievement on the planet is the Yoosilagano hall, an entire cavern five square kilometres large, filled with all manner of market stalls. It is said that there are merchants in that hall who would cut their own throats to sell you their wares as well as merchants who would cut your throat just for good measure. On average, the theft level is extremely low in the market, which may seem odd at first, until it becomes clear that everybody is pick-pocketing everyone else, and while the net balance of little things per person is the same, rare are the cases when a person walks out with his own items.</t>
    <t id="1031018">The Atropos system was the very first location that the Teladi claimed for themselves. Not entirely Teladi-friendly, the system has been turned into one of the major Teladi core sectors nevertheless. The particular sector has a large thoroughly liquid planet encircled by dense rings. The planet itself is not really habitable, but in a true Teladi fashion, the colonists have found a workaround - they have set up small colonies on the largest asteroids found in the rings, all connected together with wires, tubes and tractor beams. The unique space colonies are called carousels, after their appearance and the fact that they do not use any anti-grav batteries. Instead they use the inertial force gained by rotation of the perimeter - a cost effective solution to a problem only the Teladi worry about. Docking with said stations is an extremely complicated procedure, considering that the docking port is on a rotating circle which itself rotates around an artificial gravitational well which in turn circles the planet. Though the Teladi are notoriously bad pilots, every trader has had his share of accidents on the carousels. Due to the worn glint of overused steel of the carousels, the ring has acquired the nickname of "The Rust Belt".</t>
    <t id="1031019">A unique project is being carried out in this system. A large part of the colony population consists of scientists, bankers and learned beings of the Teladi race. The sole purpose of the planetary settlement will be the preservation of all scientific knowledge as a backup if anything unexpected should happen to the current civilizations or the current data carrying module system. All knowledge is being written down in the form of several ultra durable crystals, with select sections referring to specialized sciences. The current estimates predict that the work should be finished within five generations and the specialized storage forms should keep the data intact for several thousands of jazuras. It has been claimed that this gigantic project is somehow related to the latest advances in the Teladi-developed science of crowd relations and action probabilities. So far the Teladi have successfully encoded most of their financial knowledge that is not kept secret and are said to start work on thermodynamic engineering within a decade. </t>
    <t id="1031020">Though the sector is directly connected to its doomed neighbour with a jumpgate, the actual spatial distance between the two zones is thought to be equal to the whole radius of the galaxy. Scientists have already found the sector with their telescopes and are able to see how the two suns, that are about to go nova, are just being born out of whirling clouds of matter, all due to the relatively slow speed of light. A number of theoretical scientists have expressed their disbelief how an existing breach of causality is allowed to exist, as the observations on the growth of the stars led the astronomers to the discovery of the end of their lifecycle. Had they not observed these signs, a lot of people would have died in the ensuing sudden explosion, but now the event would not happen due to the monitoring of the cause of said event. Philosophers argue that the two events are not directly connected to each other and therefore causality does not apply. Either way, no rift in the space-time continuum has been noticed yet, so the majority of the scientific community is not overly worried about the possible consequences of the evacuation. A plea to the Chamber of Commerce has been made by the most radical researchers to keep all settlers in the sector by force, if necessary, to prevent "cataclysmic events" from occurring. The weird part is that if the Teladi government chooses to adhere to the plea, the law of causality will be breached nevertheless.</t>
    <t id="1031021">While this quiet sector and its inhabitants show no signs of anything being not quite right, the not-so-distant future holds dark times in store for all who reside here. The sun will go nova within ten jazuras and utterly devastate everything, maybe even the gates. The Teladi did not disclose the information for a whole jazura, allowing a large number of colonists to settle down on the surface of the planet unaware that they would have to move out soon. Now, the whole colony is in turmoil, with the news already spreading and whole city populations planning to leave as soon as possible. The Teladi government has promised to provide free evacuation in the last three mazuras, an offer a lot of Teladi are willing to use. For now the production on the planet continues at a slightly slower pace than usual, but profit is made and goods are produced. The owners of local space stations say that they are not worried - most of them have already closed a deal with a captain of some large transporter to move their station for them when the end of the system comes near.</t>

    <t id="1031108">With all three planets having recent scorch marks from solar flares and almost no atmosphere to speak of, the Argon have chosen to create a subterranean colony on Ukaleon I. With the plans for several high yield mines and advanced weapon production facilities, the sector is rapidly developing into an industrious powerhouse. Reports show that the remainders of asteroids, while dense, have very scarce mineral veins, resulting in low total yield ratings and problematic mining operations</t>
    <t id="1031109">The local sun, Vela, while incredibly large, is nearing its last tazuras and has already burned much of its hydrogen fuel, constantly dimming and fading. It is unknown how much time remains until the star enters its expansion phase and scorches the sector. The changes in radiation have caused ecological catastrophes on both planets of the system. In the case of Kappa IV, a vegetative bacterium has evolved and covered nearly half of the planet's surface already, rendering it uninhabitable by any species. The sector does have some minor mineral veins in asteroids, but due to the colony rush it is more focused on the short term goal of food production.</t>
    <t id="1031110">This is the furthest sector claimed in the initial expansion phase, a place where the 1st Argon Expeditionary Fleet agreed to stop and assess the situation before blindly rushing onwards, having already covered more ground at that moment than the other races. The sector is named after an old Argon fable, mentioning a star called Sirius as a beacon of hope and promise for new, undiscovered places and adventures. The system's smallest star, Sirius Beta, is thought to be very young, born due to the irregular gravitational anomalies of its largest sibling - Sirius Alpha. The strong solar radiation, emitted by Sirius Alpha, while harmless in the short term, has already turned Sirianis I into a metallic wasteland and Sirianis II into a scorched desert planet. The smaller planetoid, named Siriana Minoris, has the qualities to evolve into a major industrial habitat. Currently, the system is used as a base of operations for the Argon millitary and considered to be one of the major core sectors of Argon-controlled space in the Expansion Region.</t>
    <t id="1031111">Devoid of any planets, this asteroid-based outpost has rapidly evolved into a well maintained and organized system. With both gates enclosed by the asteroid cluster, navigation has already proven itself to be a chore and has claimed several victims during the early expansion phase. Foreseeing profit opportunities, an Argon company has set up a wharf that can repair the damage on any ships that would inevitably suffer a collision due to pilot or computer error. Incidentally, this sector has originally focused on food production, because mine building was considered to be inferior to the expansionist rush, but plans for several mining companies stationed here have already been laid out.</t>
    <t id="1031112">The first sector that the Argons established as their own was given the name New Horizons to reflect the opportunities that the Expansion Region holds. Dawnshore II is swampy and heavily laden with water vapours, and would have been a perfect habitat for the Boron, had the Argon not backed out on their agreement and claimed the sector for themselves - a fact they choose to ignore for the moment to keep the relations good. Dawnshore I, however, is abundant with resources, rich with fresh water and holds great promise for the fledging colony. The nearby asteroid cluster, while conveniently close to traffic routes, mainly consists of low-density asteroids which do not offer large production rates. This sector acts as an intermediary between the Boron and the Terrans, a fact that may lead to complications should the Argon-Boron relationship diminish.</t>

    <t id="1031114">Aldrin - the second oldest and largest of all Terran colonies established outside the Solar System during the exodus of mankind. As one of the three most beautiful planets inhabited by the human race, the other two being Earth and Argon Prime, the existence of Aldrin was considered a legend, it was known as the 'Lost Colony'. Shut off from the rest of the universe for hundreds of jazuras, no outsider was ever seen in the Solara system until two jazuras ago, when Marteen Winters found a way to Aldrin in his search for the only Terraformer CPU ship, #deca, that hadn't received the update which introduced the fatal error into their code and turned them into the Xenon.\nToday, Aldrin and with it the Solara system is ruled by the Governor of Aldrin, Ned Maher, and backing him is a traditional democratic system. The Aldrians have a strong sense of independence which conflicts with Earth's ambitions of integrating their former colony back into the Terran Democracy, as a result the relations between the two governments have begun to deteriorate shortly after the initial contact and continue to do so ever since. While Aldrin can not hope to match the military prowess of Earth's highly advanced forces, the colony does have an immense strategical advantage in terms of location. It directly borders almost all other races of the Commonwealth, therefore the majority of trade happens through Aldrian customs and with Aldrian permission, greatly boosting their economy and allowing them to stay competitive without the large backing that the other races have.</t>
    <t id="1031115">Initially known as 'Aldrin 2', the sandy desert planet Armstrong is the closest stellar body to the sun Solara in the entire system. As the former location of one of the Solara system's jumpgates, the one to be activated first during the inital expansion efforts by the Terrans, this area has currently lost some of its significance as the jumpgate was moved into the Howard Asteroid Field where it could be defended more easily.\nToday, Armstrong is the location of an Aldrin Self-Defence Force naval base but apart from that it is not very populated at all. The Aldrin Military Research Laboratories are known to frequent this area for field tests. Recent rumours indicate that they have also established a permanent presence here in the form of an orbital research laboratory.\nIn the last mazuras, the local population has shown concern over the frequent sightings of Yaki ships in the area. The Syndicate is believed to have established a major base of operations in this system.</t>
    <t id="1031116">Conrad is a large gas planet orbiting Solara and lies on one of the key routes through the system. There are several large gas collectors located within the atmosphere of the planet which have just recently been put back into service and outfitted with the latest technology after having been deactiveated for several decades due to the low demand of the mined gases. The demand is now there and growing resulting in the Solaran government deciding to invest heavily and begin the construction of one massive gas collector, dwarfing all existing installations, and several smaller collectors in order to meet or succeed the demand for at least the next ten years.</t>
    <t id="1031117">With the initially lifeless Atropos II thoroughly inhabited now, Teladi managers have turned the whole planet into a virtual bank. The large and distinguishable infrastructure does not feature a single factory - the whole network of partial underground buildings is designed to accommodate Teladi clerks, bank managers and loan sharks. The planet survives thanks to the Teladi way of dealing with money and it actually generates the best revenue of all Teladi sectors while not really producing anything. The best part is that all of the money is in credit form. There are no riches in the vaults and no backing to the banks - everything happens with automated accounts and little pulses of electricity. Some doomsayers have begun to preach about a "bubble" that is going to "burst" soon, pulling the whole stock industry so carefully maintained by the Teladi down with it, but the vast majority are not concerned with such nonsense - it is widely known that the Teladi will never ever let any money go to waste, regardless of its owner.</t>
    <t id="1031118">This sector was used as a repair and refit position for the 4th Teladi Profit-Augmentation Fleet at the early stages of the expansion. Elaborate satellite system used to track all explorer scouts and send an immediate warning of new jumpgate discoveries. Then the fleet would be sent on its way in mere mizuras. Now the fleet has moved onwards and the sector has ceased to serve as a central location - due to it being near the border of Teladi space, the jump costs were deemed far too large for continued support of the fleet. Now both of the system's planets are used as basic resource producers and exporters, with a large share of the fruit of their labour going to the neighbouring industrial planets. Sizeable amounts of raw food extracts are also shipped to the Solara system, ensuring that the planet in itself makes as much revenue as possible. There are almost zero overseers on the planets - the colonists themselves are driven by an extreme lust for profits and push their hardest to do as much as possible.</t>
    <t id="1031119">This sector offers a strange view on the inhabited moon. Situated directly between the sun and the sector, in an orbital arrangement that is maintained continuously, the moon is almost perfectly shrouded in shadow. The rich infrastructure on the dark side illuminates the black surface, creating a wonderful example of how technological advance can make decent art. The green sun of the system is a minor star that can only provide moderate warmth and very low radiation. Due to this, the vegetation of the main planet has experienced very slow and uninspired evolutionary cycles, with certain species of plants remaining unchanged throughout aeons. No wildlife can be found on the planet, since there is nothing to inspire the necessary mutation that would create predatory cells - all life forms are based purely on photosynthesis. The Teladi are using the sector for various purposes and no certain role has been assigned to the sector. Currently, it is a free-for-all system where anything goes and no limitations on stations are in effect.</t>
    <t id="1031120">The blue planet Gossylasos is seemingly fit for colonization, but the Teladi settlers have chosen to colonize its sizeable moon instead, claiming that building a fresh industrial network on the moon would be far cheaper to start at than working through the rich vegetation of the planet. By now, the moon has been transformed into an industrial hub and the settlers have not expressed any desire to move to the planet and suffer through the hardships of colonization again. The rich green nebula seen from the system is an old remnant of a so-called "pillar of creation", a place where new stars are born. The system's sun, Gossyleas I, is a red dwarf of the M spectral type. With an estimated lifespan of nearly four times the one of an average star, the system is thought to be able to survive and outlive most other systems in the Teladi section of the Expansion Region. The nebula itself no longer has enough matter density to allow the formation of new stars and only an event such as an explosion of a nearby supernova could spark new cycles of genesis. Since the red dwarf is among the least likely candidates to go nova, it can be safely assumed that the system will not see anything impressive for the next hundred million jazuras.</t>
    <t id="1031121">This sector is the event site of a tragedy. Being recently claimed, the system was seeing a large number of colony ships passing through the main gate. One tazura a long chain of large transporters was scheduled to arrive in the system loaded with special fusion reactors for the ground-based colonies. Right after exiting the gate, an engine malfunction caused the leading Albatross to stop right in the middle of the gate exit point. Moments later, the next transporter plunged right into the rear section of the leading ship, resulting in an explosion of both. The debris left by the two transporters was large enough to cause further destruction of all nine remaining transporters, resulting in a loss of more than seven thousand lives and several billion credits in equipment value. The development of the system was thrown back by mazuras and the high cost of reimbursement caused two insurance companies to declare bankruptcy. This incident has led to several changes in the organization of supply convoys. Now they are obliged to have scouts on either side of the gates that report all issues, and a time-out between gate traversing is a mandatory requirement.</t>

    <t id="1031206">The giant desert planet Venusia is consistently battered with vicious sand storms, a fact that explains the low population levels of the single city, Tamaria. The sector itself has a large emphasis on food production in order to cater to the needs of its neighbours. The sparse asteroid field is deemed to be of low quality, but no specific scanning has been performed yet. With the low population and high upkeep tax of the stations, this system is currently a major drain on the Argon treasury and is rumoured to face auctioning in the following jazuras. The government so far has shown no interest in turning this auction publicly open. As the spokesman of the Senate said, "There is no chance of a private entrepreneur out-bidding a race government, so why should we bother teasing them at all?"</t>
    <t id="1031207">This area is not owned by any race, since it does not provide a shortcut to any other sector. The distant sun and the two cold and lifeless planets that orbit it at a close distance offer nothing for prospective colonists. It is currently used as a remote test zone for new Argon and OTAS ship designs.</t>
    <t id="1031208">Though the planet Segovia I appears luscious and habitable, it is teeming with hostile wildlife that seems to have gone through a crash course of evolution. A number of incidents leading to deaths of whole construction brigades and the loss of expensive equipment have forced the Argon to give up on the plans of colonization and focus their attention on Segovia II instead. The unusual tint of the sunlight is proved to have a calming effect on most life forms, a fact that the cattle breeders have exploited, leading to a 25% reduction in maintenance costs. The fauna of the planet is also exceptionally calm, with nearly non-existent predator species.</t>
    <t id="1031209">A unique tertiary planetary arrangement is held in place only because of the incredibly dense minor planetoid Gemini Delta, which holds the giants Gemini Alpha and Gemini Beta apart. The spectacular sight and the gravitational anomalies have captivated the interest of many astronomers. The colonisation efforts are focused on Gemini Beta, leaving its sandy counterpart and their common satellite-sister untouched. The sector is favoured by wheat farmers because of the mild sunlight of Lupus that does not harm the fragile crop. Several investors have advised the Argon Senate to ensure that nothing but wheat is grown in the sector. Whether this decision is accepted or not remains to be seen.</t>
    <t id="1031210">Sirius III is currently one of the most advanced of the Argon sectors. The acquisition of territory on Siriana Majoris is not going as smoothly as expected - numerous craters cover the face of the planet, suggesting that this giant comes under frequent meteoroid showers regularly and may turn out to be unfit for industrial development. Sirius III itself has already evolved into a cradle of advanced technology, in no small part thanks to the influence of the OTAS Corporation, which has chosen this place as their base of operations in the Expansion Region.</t>
    <!-- <t id="1031211">10 / 11</t> -->
    <t id="1031212">This sector was originally known as Terran Unknown Sector 2. Previously undiscovered by Terran expedition fleets, it was locked by accident in an effort to cut the connection to a Kha'ak infested system. It is here that the direct gate to Neptune was built, serving as a bridge between the Commonwealth sector cluster and the new Expansion Region and eliminating the need to use jumpdrive to access Aldrin and the Solara system. Now, the gate has been repositioned and the sector serves only as a minor link between the Terrans and the newly claimed Boron and Argon territories.</t>
    <t id="1031213">Previously known as Terran Unknown Sector 1, the sector was reclaimed from the Xenon during the initial rediscovery of Aldrin. The rampant Terraformers had decimated the aging colony at a slow and ponderous pace, denying the luckless settlers a quick and merciful death. It has now been repopulated and is once again under Terran rule. A large military presence ensures that such a tragedy will never happen again. The reshaping of the destroyed ecosystem is taking a heavy toll on the settlers, but it is a burden they wish to bear until the end in order to honour those brave men and women who died without a chance of escape.</t>
    <t id="1031214">Located in the outskirts of the Solara system, the Howard Asteroid Field marks the beginning of the Namira Cloud which encompasses the whole of the Solara system, similar to the Oort Cloud of the Sol system. Although it is a vast asteroid field containing large amounts of minerals, it wasn’t opened up to civilian access until 2940, when the Aldrian government decided that their growing economy could use the boost in production by setting up mines on some of the high yield asteroids located in the field. Here, in this sector located near the edge of the Namira Cloud, one of the Solara system's seven jumpgates can be found. After its reactivation by the Terrans in the year 2941, exactly a year after the re-discovery of the Aldrin Colony, a Xenon fleet immediately entered the sector but was destroyed shortly thereafter by ATF forces.\nUntil recently it has been very quiet in the Howard Asteroid Field as the Terrans have freed the adjacent sector of its AGI plague and occupied the sector themselves. In recent mazuras, however, sightings of 'Black Hand' pirate clan ships have been frequently submitted to local authorities. This is especially disconcerting as the 'Black Hand' pirate clan is old and has just stopped limiting their activities to the Namira Cloud, which provides a protection for their ships from detection.</t>
    <t id="1031215">When the Terran fleet, lead by the ATF Commander Mark Jackson, jumped to capture Marteen Winters in 2939, they arrived in this sector. Located in the orbit of the third stellar object of the system, the planetoid Collins, this area was the stage for the battle between ATF forces and the Terraformer CPU ship, deca, that was controlled by the former chief engineer of the Terraformer project - Marteen Winters. Once the outcome of the battle was decided, the Terrans swiftly began to take up diplomatic relations with the newly uncovered Aldrin Colony. Several Trans-Orbital Accelerator gates were built, connecting the different locations of the Solara system with each other in a bid to make them more accessible to regular ships. With its central position in the Solara system, the barren planetoid has played an important role from the very beginning and even more so after the construction of the Terran jumpgate was finished and its connection by Trans-Orbital Accelerators directly to this sector in 2941.\nLately, tensions in the Aldrian-Terran relations, especially since the recent closure of the Pandora Gate, have led to a noticeable animosity of the local inhabitants towards Terran forces, as the trade and traffic induced through the Terran gate was the only major source of income for the whole of the Solara system. It is believed that the fortification of this sector, which consisted of the construction of a large military base on the surface of Collins as well as the reinforcement of the defence fleet, is a direct reaction of the Aldrian government to this new situation and an ample warning of future plans and events.</t>
    <t id="1031216">Bean is the outermost planet in the Solara System. Possessing not much of an atmosphere to speak of, it harbours a large naval base of the Aldrin Self-Defence Forces nevertheless. Although the original naval base on Bean's establishment dates back before the Terraformer War, it was abandoned for a long time and only taken into service a few years ago. Since then it has experienced a considerable growth, especially as it lies on one of the main trade routes through the Solara System and is often frequented by traders as a place to rest. As a result, trade has also flourished around the naval base.</t>
    <t id="1031217">Being a twin star system, Gordon represents the second and minor star in the Solara system. Circling around Solara in far elliptic orbit, Gordon completes its circle once every 129 jazuras. The only reason why this area has ever been connected to the main stellar bodies of the system is its jumpgate, leading to the Teladi sector of Atropos II. This fact, however, makes Gordon an important node for trade in the Solara system and the Aldrin Self-Defence Force is forced to patrol these outer areas of the system more frequently as attacks on the many trading convoys traversing here have increased considerably over the last mazuras.</t>
    <t id="1031218">The sector is used primarily to serve as a front for the Teladi and Paranid trade relations. None of the three planets in the system are largely inhabited. The gates are situated in a stable orbit around the system's gas giant, Yiselayas. The topmost layers of its atmosphere are illuminated by the extremely strong radiation of the system's sun. Thought to be a new star, it emits high velocity solar winds and frequent outbursts of the surface matter itself have been noticed. This is thought to occur due to intense fluctuations of the star's magnetic field, which are caused by a small, dense planetoid orbiting closely around the star. The sector itself is far enough from the centre of the system to not be affected by the suns outbursts, but it does receive very minor yet constant radiation. The gas giant seems to be shielded from the radiation quite effectively; it also provides a cover for the whole sector, but the two planets closer to the star are completely cold. Their cores have stopped spinning and are thought to be rigid all the way through, leading to the loss of their own magnetic fields. The surface, eternally bombarded by gamma radiation emitted by the sun, is now incapable of supporting even the most resilient of bacteria.</t>
    <t id="1031219">This system is now owned by the Nividium Mining and Manufacturing Corporation. Originally claimed by the Teladi Company, they soon found that the sector did not hold any bright profit opportunities. The NMMC deemed this system fit to serve as their new planetary HQ and have taken complete control of all four sectors. Now disbanded from the Teladi government rule, they enforce their own justice in the sector and choose not to abide by the laws of Commonwealth anymore. This has led to their Commonwealth branch becoming unfavoured by the Teladi, it is now operating at a constant loss. Since the money is now in the Expansion Region, the NMMC has appealed to the Commonwealth council of races to admit them as a free state as opposed to a corporation. It is likely that the races will agree, because NMMC's backhanded deals and numerous attempts on cheating and swindling have eventually acquired the bad reputation that they deserve.</t>
    <t id="1031220">The sector contains a number of asteroids that may have been the major reason why the NMMC decided to occupy the system. Several traders and freighter pilots have claimed that decent amounts of Nividium have been found in the sector. So far, NMMC have not released new minerals into the market, so the rumours of the valuable mineral content of the asteroids cannot be proved. Otherwise this is a bleak and fairly empty part of the system and sees only very moderate industrial activity. The asteroid field is now called "Olckamanckstrat's Deception", due to a particular race event that occurred a few mazuras ago. A Paranid outcast joined the list of racers with a Demeter tanker ship. Though ridiculed at start, he soon claimed his place in the hall of racing fame. He had hidden a Hercules loaded with mines and lasertowers in the asteroid field, and, in the first lap, flew to the TL, beamed the squash mines into his own hold, flew back on track and laid a closely knitted minefield. When the other racers, on their second lap, approached the minefield, Olckamanckstrat returned to his secret stash, picked up the lasertowers and laid them around the edges of the minefield, forming a semi-cone that reaches its sharp point at the minefield. All racers fell for the trap and their ships were destroyed. Olckamanckstrat was declared a winner by default and subsequently all racing ships were fitted with special devices that block the transporter device's positioning systems, so that no secret weapons and mines could be beamed aboard during the race.</t>

    <t id="1031305">As a minor subsector of the Juno system, this zone is used as training and testing grounds for new ships. Though deemed to be one of the safest and most remote corners of the Expansion Region, the local security is rather lax and often skips their pre-destined flight paths and scheduled flights, allowing for some piracy to bloom in the sector. No known pirate clans have put themselves forward here yet, so it is thought that only freelance raiders reside here without any actual organization backing them up.</t>
    <t id="1031306">With the joined effort of Pavo Alpha and Pavo Beta, the surface of Pavonis has been turned into a sizzling silicate sand layer. With a heat-resistant dome already covering the developing city of Mesunra, the population is steadily increasing. The sector itself has undergone rapid development despite its neighbour being under control of the Nue Kingdom. The Argon secret service is still keeping a close eye on this sector, possibly seeking to extend their influence over the reigning king of the Nue Kingdom.</t>
    <t id="1031307">High amounts of neon gas have rendered the otherwise beautiful planet Sostello uninhabitable by all races. The infrastructure development on Minastell is going extremely well, with the most of the planet's dark side already illuminated. Though ready to be settled, a lack of colonists has led to the population numbers hardly rising above the one million mark. The Argon government is already considering converting the planet into a single automated mining facility that could provide a cheap mineral flow at extremely low cost, but there still remains the problem of delivering the heavy loads from the surface to space.</t>
    <t id="1031308">Initially no more than a mere outpost for the expansion, the planet Aharon II was discovered to support vegetation growth of unexpected rates. Tides on the planets are exceptionally strong due to the unique binary moon arrangement. The sector itself is dedicated to food production, with plans for the exploitation of the small asteroid cluster scrapped in favour of more urgent needs. It is rumoured that the asteroids form an arrow that points to the location of an abandoned Argon secret technology storage facility. The government has denied any knowledge of such a place.</t>
    <t id="1031309">Orbiting a binary star system, the planetary giant Oscilleus II has proved itself a valuable acquisition, established early in the second expansion phase. However, industrial planetside development is slow due to the treacherous terrain and the impenetrable forests. Local vegetation is highly poisonous, but rumours of hidden treasure left by an unknown race are driving the colonists on more than any government tax reductions. The nearby Oscilleus I is fully covered in toxic vapours, emitted by a newly discovered breed of algae. Only two of the fifteen colony ships returned from the planet, carrying the few lucky survivors. Because of this unsavoury event, the sector is secretly shunned and considered cursed. Few companies choose to establish themselves in this ominous place.</t>
    <t id="1031310">Caught midway between Cetus Minoris and Cetus Majoris, the planets are not easily habitable and do not abide the regular day-night cycle. Forceful Acquisition was established at a great rush due to the Argon and Terran expeditionary fleets both racing to claim the sector for themselves. Much to the dismay of the Terran government, the sector owners have withdrawn the right to use the ice asteroids in the sector to the Terrans, which are now thoroughly exploited by the Argon. This has led to a dispute between the Argon and the Terran governments. The intense radiation and abundance of light makes it hard for most colonists to settle down. Delusions have already established themselves in the heads of the inhabitants, and claims of the sector being on an "Evil Axis" outlined by the stars are spreading faster than wildfire.</t>
    <!-- <t id="1031311">10 / 12</t> -->
    <t id="1031312">This sector was found by a mere accident. A wing of scouts had strayed off-course while patrolling the outskirts of New Hampshire when they came upon a new gate reading in the edge of their scanners. They found this old-forgotten colony, which has now been re-established. The most notable object found here is an old data module containing a log of a certain Terran Colonization Fleet that had crossed the sector more than 800 jazuras ago, roughly at the same time the Terraformers attacked Earth and forced it to cut all connections with its colonies. The data module also contained clear directions to a system called Melpomenia and a note saying "This is only the start of the expansion". Now the sector is heavily guarded by the Terran military, and a large settlement has been developed on the planet.</t>
    <t id="1031313">The sector was renamed shortly after the war with the Terraformers in hopes of leaving the history behind. The Terraformers completely decimated the ecosystem and climate of the planet Terranova but no civilians were harmed; they had all escaped to safety in the neighbouring systems and were not exposed to the Terraformer attack. Though the fight for a clear escape passage had been fierce, no Terran ships were left behind and sacrificed as the military successfully repelled the invaders for several stazuras before retreating themselves. It is a mystery why the Terraformers left all artificial structures intact, but it has eased the re-colonization of the planet and the establishment of its new principal colony, New Hampshire.</t>
    <t id="1031314">This is the current location of the Neptune gate. This sector is located in the outskirts of the Solara system and is the only Terran-owned territory within the orbit of Solara. One of the main Terran military bases, Fuji Station, is located here and it is thought to be established purely in order to keep a close eye on Aldrian activities, since the two factions are highly suspicious of each other despite all appearances. Heavy military security is constantly kept in the sector, and since the closing for civilian traffic, no one is allowed to cross this special gate without an official permission. A few tried to sneak through but they were dealt with swiftly and efficiently.</t>

    <t id="1031316">As the first of the Paranid-owned sectors in the Expansion Region, this system was chosen by the Priest King only because of the fact that the sector had 3 planets. Now serving as an almost neutral ground for negotiations with ambassadors of other races, this sector sees modest trade between Aldrin and Paranids. The nebula seen from the sector is said to be nearly identical to the one enshrouding Paranid Prime, yet another reason why such a large number of Paranid colonists and priests have come here. The 3rd Grand Paranid Missionary Fleet did not bother to stay long in the previously uninhabited and empty sector; after ensuring police protection, they moved onwards in hopes of finding new races to convert to the teachings of the three-dimensionality.</t>

    <t id="1031319">Owned by the NMMC, this sector now serves as a neutral meeting place for the ambassadors of the Profit Guild. Though it is far away from any Split colonies, the relative proximity to both Teladi and Paranid territories make the sector an excellent place for any secret and important meetings, a place where judgement is not influenced by any race and where no ambassador has a "home advantage". This is also the start and finish of the famous NMMC Ring Rush Race - a special event where contestants have to race in their ships against each other and do a certain amount of laps throughout the 4 sectors of the system. Any ship is allowed, no tactic is illegal - the racers are allowed to go in a Starburst and hope to outrun the opposition or they can use a destroyer to literally destroy their opponents. The contest is strictly outlawed by all other races; therefore the track will not be extended any time soon. So far, the most notorious event in the racing history happened right at the first gate - a team of two frigates parked themselves besides the gate and shot down all racers who had not taken enough shields with them. This improvised siege ended in a flash when a rival corvette stealthily pushed one of the frigates into the gate itself with the help of a heavily modified tractor beam.</t>
    <t id="1031320">Being closer to the system's sun than all other planets, the local moon houses a large industrial city sprawling all over the surface. The increased surface temperature does take a heavy toll out of the workforce, but the cost reduction on ore smelting plants is something no Teladi can pass up. The intense solar wind is a major factor in the race that takes part in the system regularly - a lot of racing ships feature improvised solar sails that help with the acceleration and serve as a handy trap to use against another racer. Due to the fact that all cameras are facing the sun in the sector, the more opportunistic racers often choose this place to have a weapon trigger malfunction and accidentally cause damage to the engines and life support systems of their competitors.</t>
    <t id="1031321">Initially, plans for colonization were developed by the NMMC, but soon it was discovered that the planets all feature poisonous gases in their atmosphere as well as large amounts of radioactive compounds in the soil. Deemed uninhabitable, the system is now abandoned and only occasionally used as a retreat zone for raiding pirates.</t>

    <t id="1031405">Owned by the Free State of Juno, the sector is a safe haven for anyone who has grown tired of the constant bickering of Argon and Terran governments. Though the Terrans have their fair share of influence over the government of Juno, the sector remains fairly liberal and unhindered by the strict and cumbersome security laws of the both races. Despite it being a free state, the military prowess of the Juno system is not to be underestimated - a number of police ships are brand new and capable of dealing with any would-be pirate seeking some easy pickings. The Free State of Juno also serves as a universal neutral system, where the Argons and the Terrans can converse unhindered by a home field advantage. The system was previously ruled by a monarch and was designated as the Kingdom of Juno. That changed when the Juno Liberation Front overthrew the totalitarian regime and formed the Free State. The Council of the Free State now consists entirely out of the rebel leaders, but even here corruption is a common thing.</t>
    <t id="1031406">Officially controlled by the liberal Nue Kingdom, the sector is the target of the Argon government. Constant propaganda messages are streamed to the system, and several hidden assassination attempts have been made against the reigning king. In spite of all the seeming effort that the Argon take to gain control of the minds of the subjects, most analysts claim that the king is already but a puppet for the Argon government and that the charade is kept only for appearances. The sector is fairly secure, with both Argon and Terran traders frequenting the lanes and bringing decent revenue into the private funds of the royal family. Some reports on less than legal deals have been noted though, but the security forces have turned a blind eye, maintaining the appearance that everything is perfect and nothing bad ever happens here.</t>

    <t id="1031412">This sector was the last known location of the remnants of the Terraformer fleet that had attacked the neighbouring colonies. It is claimed that the last of the Terraformer fighters had been destroyed in the sector, even though there are rumours claiming that a lone ship had jumped away. Now, this sector is little more than a place with an important past. It is under the direct control of the Terran Democracy and is often used for fleet maneuvers and as a military training area.</t>
    <t id="1031413">Once planned as a mining colony, this sector fell under the Terraformer control early in the Terraformer War 800 jazuras ago. They quickly overwhelmed the colonisation ships and began to terraform the planet relentlessly until it was no longer suitable for life. Some of the Xenon encountered in this sector a jazura ago showed battle scars of Commonwealth origin, supporting the theory that they used the Hub to traverse between the Commonwealth and this Terran frontier region, where they evolved. Now all Xenon have been eliminated in a massive ATF operation and the sector has been claimed by the Terran Democracy. It has been turned into a fledging colony, despite the irreparable harm done to the planet. It is a landmark of the Terran victory over their enemies, of the victory of human emotions over a cold, calculating mind.</t>

    <t id="1031416">Another sector with three big planets - the moon has mysteriously evaded the attention of the priests. The Paranid, upon entering the sector, were finally convinced that they had chosen the right path and that this section of the Expansion Region would hold many scores of three planetary objects for them to settle. Due to the intense red nebula seen in the sky, the Priest Ceremonial Master called for the rite of Oclambagamanck to be performed. Three Paranid High Priests performed the ritual ceremony of Eileithyianamanck to ensure good luck on the holy quest of enlightenment that the Paranid had undertaken. With the customs abided, the Paranids felt free to move on in search of new grounds, new converts and new heights of benevolence. The sector is now focused on food production, but large asteroid fields hold a promise for a strong mining industry, which is planned to be constructed in the following mazuras.</t>
    <!-- <t id="1031417">16 / 13</t> -->
    <t id="1031418">Originally claimed by the Teladi, this sector was soon afterwards bought by the Paranids in exchange for granting the exclusive right for Teladi investors to set up stations in Paranid core space. It is not known why the Paranids sought to overtake the sector so eagerly - it does have a binary star system and 2 nearly identical planets with perfectly equal flora and fauna, but nothing here can be attributed or connected to the number three and no precious artifacts nor notable species have been found on the planets or among the drifting asteroids. Currently serving as the border between the Teladi Company and the Paranid Empire, the planets have been distributed fairly - one planet houses Teladi settlements, the other - Paranid colonies. It is thought that the Teladi saw this as an opportunity to infiltrate the Paranid economy; if so, they have not been widely successful yet.</t>
    <t id="1031419">The single inhabitable planet Akara is on the brink of destruction: Due to the constantly accelerating rotation of the planet and the intense solar wind, it is slowly losing its atmosphere. Thousands of indigenous species have died due to a lack of carbon dioxide, water vapour is nearly non-existent, leaving everything crumbled and dry. No evidence of space-capable of even self-sentient species has been found on the surface, so it is uncertain whether this catastrophe was caused by irresponsible actions, determined intentions or was just destined to occur sooner or later. The Paranids have set up a minor colony underground, distinguished by its revolutionary layout. Only three long tunnels join the hollowed complex deep underground and on the surface, each of them featuring nine hermetic compartments that can be used as atmospheric barriers. Currently no secret projects or advanced industry is known to exist here, and the plans for the future development of the colony have not been disclosed.</t>
    <t id="1031420">Do not let the name fool you - this sector is owned by a theocratic dictator, thought to keep close contact with pirate clans for military supplies and illegal wares. The Republic's inhabitants are living tough, harsh lives and are essentially brainwashed into believing that they have it far better than other beings. Due to extreme censorship and an impenetrable information firewall blocking the whole planet, a large share of people think that the Republic extends over all the Expansion Region and that it is completely blocked off from the Commonwealth. Due to the remoteness of the sector and a lack of any valuable resources, no government has put forward any plans for an invasion into this sector.</t>
    <t id="1031421">This sector was only recently connected to the gate network. It seems to have escaped all gate re-arrangements and has not been connected to anywhere. It is not known why there are gates in the sector, or who placed them.</t>

    <t id="1031505">Less than two jazuras ago the planet of Vega was completely covered with a baking, arrid desert. The Terran colonists launched an experimental project on the planet with the goal of achieving complete vegetation, climate tempering and development of an ecosystem. So far, the experiment has been a major success and now the planet has a rich atmosphere and strong vegetation covering most of the surface. The radiation from the system's sun is deflected by a thin layer of artificially introduced ozone gas, allowing for various life forms to live on the planet without the necessity of artificial protection. Vega played a large role in the rebel uprising in the previously strong Kingdom of Juno. The weapons developed here as well as select militia teams helped the rebels to form the Free State of Juno. As thanks, the inhabitants of Juno are now keeping close ties with the Terran Federation and the Vega sector in particular.</t>
    <t id="1031506">This system is the home of the most advanced agricultural colony in the all of the Terran owned territory in the Expansion Region. Both of the planets are used for the cultivation of various plants, with hot and dry climate loving spices and fruit being grown on Kalgan I and various vegetables grown in the more temperate climate of Kalgan II. The system is a major exporter of food for other colonies and a large logistics centre is currently under construction on Kalgan II to ensure proper distribution of transports and to improve the logistics and income by more than ten percent. The sector is fairly close to the edge of the Terran controlled territory and provides much needed support to the rebels of the Free State of Juno in their effort to overthrow their previous king.</t>
    <t id="1031507">The system is centred around the identical binary stars, Locris I and Locris II. They are both interfering with each other's composition and form, as a result both of them have acquired an elongated shape. Whilst being nearly identical in surface diameter, revolution speed and density, they are formed of radically different components. The consequence of the different compositions is that one of the stars shines with a rich red light, while the other gives out a cool blue radiation. There are no planets in the Locris system, the sector is situated near a small asteroid deposit, which is being thoroughly exploited by Terran enterprises. It is directly connected to the Boron territories, and relations between the two races are maintained at a decent level in order to accommodate free trading.</t>
    <!-- <t id="1031508">07 / 14</t> -->
    <t id="1031509">This system is fairly empty, consisting of only a single gas giant orbiting the local sun at a close distance. The surface temperature of the giant is estimated to keep at 450°C, making any major colonization nearly impossible. So far, a single city has been built just below the topmost layer of the atmosphere, kept in position by inflated spheres and emergency engines. Only scientists live in the city as it is too dangerous for actual colonization. The sector experiences moderate traffic, but it is thought to be of low strategic and economic importance.</t>
    <t id="1031510">One of the most important discoveries the Terrans made in the whole Expansion Region occurred in the orbit of this system's planet, Melpomenia. A long-abandoned ancient Terran space station was drifting in a stable orbit around Melpomenia, with life support systems deactivated, but still capable of functioning. The Terran military squad that was sent on board to investigate was surprised to see that a part of the automated sensors picked up their approach and booted the core systems of the station. However, no data storage devices were found and there was no data left regarding the fate of the previous occupants. In the centre room of the station, a silicate slab was found with inscriptions of several system names which were later adopted by the Terrans and are now used for sector designations and cryptic coordinates. It was this exact discovery that determined the course of further Terran expansion. No other signs of previous colonization have been found on the planet. Currently both the moon and the planet itself are heavily colonized and serving as one of the major Terran core sectors in the Expansion Region. The ancient station has been towed to an unknown location and is under close inspection by military researchers.</t>

    <t id="1031518">Dominated by the white gas giant Actaeon, the system houses only one inhabitable planet which has now occupied by the Paranids. An interesting artifact was recovered on the surface of the planet - a huge and empty dome with three angular sides was found half-buried in the rock, exactly one third of the equator away from the closest pole and two thirds away from the furthest. What's even more confusing, the dome had a single object in it - a seemingly perfect sphere, which upon closer inspection revealed itself to be a fractal of a triangular pyramid, repeating itself endlessly on the flat surfaces. The Priest Emperor of the Colonies has already diverted a large number of scientists to study how many times this example of fractal geometry repeats itself. Currently the scientists have succeeded to uncover three thousand layers, the smallest of them being barely larger than a silicate molecule. The dome itself is now a revered place and a favourite destination for all Paranids who are seeking enlightenment. The Paranid have strictly forbidden any form of industry to be set up on the planets surface, with all cities being dedicated to the needs and customs of Paranid religion.</t>
    <t id="1031519">Sharing the same level of secrecy as its neighbour, this sector serves as a staging post for several task force fleets and defence agencies. The ominous black moon, clearly seen on the backdrop of the planet Dionysus, is forbidden to be approached closer than two light mizuras, far surpassing the range of any scanning device. Whatever it is the Paranids are or aren't doing there, they wish it to remain a secret and are ready to retaliate at first sight of danger. Twice a whole fleet jumped in due to false activation of the hidden security system; once, a lone and perhaps confused spacefly triggered the automated alarms, and once a drunk pirate passed out in his cockpit, slumped over the controls and set the ship straight on course to the moon. On both occasions the trespassers were promptly annihilated. The mission logs show that the spacefly had put up more resistance than the pirate, and that it had taken the fleet several mizuras to hit the agile creature.</t>

    <t id="1031606">The fractured moon that orbits the superheated gas giant is the site of another discovery for the Terran colonization fleet. Remnants of an underground facility were found very close to the rupture lines of the moon's largest parts. It was discovered that the facility had been built with Terran design and constructional habits, since the system was marked on the Melpomenia map, it is thought that this was yet another colony of the old Terran settlers. At the core of the moon, a large facility was found. The remnants of its equipment seemed to be connected to experiments with nuclear fusion. It is speculated that a large Terraformer attack had occurred shortly after the settlement process and caused the moon to break apart. Currently the main parts of the moon are kept in place with a number of cables and support beams and a new settlement is being laid on the surface of the moon's largest section. The gas giant is uninhabitable due to extremely high surface temperature and volatile storms of the topmost layer.</t>
    <t id="1031607">Several old shipwrecks were found drifting among the asteroids in the outer rings that encircle the small planet named Terel. All of those ships appeared to be old Terran design capital ships, most of them being heavily modified for capacity. It is not clear what sort of malfunctions caused the old hulls to be abandoned, but all of them seem to have at least partially working engine arrays, even though life support systems seemed to be damaged beyond any repair. A small notebook was found on the bridge of one wreck, its contents are classified and unavailable to the general public. The planet itself is entirely covered with water and large colonies of floating algae. Several floating cities have been built by the Terrans to accommodate a large population. The sector serves as a militaristic centre for the Terran fleets and a fully functional shipyard and an equipment dock have been built in the sector.</t>
    <t id="1031608">This sector is among those charted on the Melpomenia map. No traces of any technology has been found in the sector so far, but the local planet, Synnax, has a strangely faint radioactive signature found in the single-cell organisms that were discovered in various places on the planet's surface. Such radiation is known to be a consequence of a nuclear blast, a thing that does not occur naturally. The surface of the planet seems to be free of any radioactive isotopes and therefore the planet was acknowledged as a fitting place for a new Terran colony. The settlement is focusing on industrial development and technological research, with the majority of resources being shipped in from neighbouring systems.</t>
    <t id="1031609">Another location of an abandoned and ruined Terran colony. The remains of the settlement found by a team of explorers was small and featured no preserved data storage devices or technological artifacts, except for an old broken wrist watch found among the rubble of a building. It's design almost exactly matches the ones used by the Terrans about 800 jazuras ago - compelling evidence to the age of the colony and the fact that it had been built by Terran people. Large underground passages have been found under the ruins of the settlement, but they seem to lead nowhere, all of them ending abruptly at large stone slates. Currently the planet, Glyptal II, has been turned into a large Terran colony, specializing in consumable ware production. The temperate climate allows for fast growth of all plants brought along by the settlers. The local sun, Glyptal, is casting a faint orange light on the atmosphere of the planet, creating incredibly beautiful sunsets.</t>
    <t id="1031610">The planet Cinna IV is a swirling ball of molten lava. The system's sun, Cinna, is casting light in the red spectrum, illuminating everything in the sector with various shades of dark red. A small star can be seen next to Cinna. Initially thought to be a binary system, after some research it turned out that the small star, now called Rigel, is actually a supernova several hundred light jazuras away. Estimated to fade away in less than a jazura, the system poses an excellent opportunity for astronomers to measure the effects of intense gravity on light and how it bends near Cinna. Cinna was one of the systems mentioned in the cryptic map found on Melpomenia, but no artificial structures have been found anywhere in the system.</t>
    <t id="1031611">Remains of an old Terran settlement have been found on the small moon Lagos II. There is no data available on who built the colony in the first place and for what reason. Exploration teams sent to uncover any relics and data storage modules have so far been unsuccessful in finding anything that is not broken or corroded; it seems that the high acid vapour contents in the thin atmosphere of the moon is capable of ruining any metal within decades. The lithium dating method has helped to establish that the colony is roughly eight hundred jazuras old. The very newest object found has an age of only a hundred jazuras, however, therefore it is unknown how long the settlers had lived here and why and where have they moved. The scientists claim that the only noteworthy object that the settlers could have studied is the liquid planet Lagos I, consisting of liquid light metals that rarely stay in such a state in laboratories and controlled environments. Now the system is occupied by the Terrans once more and so far no person has shown the urge to leave.</t>
    <t id="1031612">Home of the Veritas Theocracy, a union of Paranid extremists and fanatics. All bypassing ships that are not made and flown by Paranid's are under constant threat of assault, since the motto of the system's crazed inhabitants is &quot;If it is unholy, it has to be purged from the universe&quot;. The only thing that is holding them off from an attempt at a galaxy-wide crusade is their close connection with the Paranid Empire, which would get into a lot of trouble if the fighters of Veritas Theocracy begun to shoot at other traders. The spiritual leader of the Theocracy is thought to be behind a number of suicide bombings and attacks on civilian ships, but nothing has be proven so far. It is not recommended to enter the sector with a large military ship; the Veritas fleet may interpret it as an invasion of their territory and retaliate.</t>
    <t id="1031613">This sector is flooded in deep, blood-red colour, emitted by the dying sun Nereus I. In the late stages of a red giant, the sun is expected to collapse any jazura now, eventually forming a small white dwarf. The imminent collapse of the sun is thought to be the end of the sector and it is not clear whether even the gates will withstand the cataclysmic event. The Paranid have estimated that there is still some time left and so the planets are being settled without much concern of the future. Due to the ominous tint the sun emits, the sector is a prime candidate for the staging of deathmatches, thought to invoke the darkest and deepest primal instincts of the Paranid fighters. So far it has proven to be true, with one champion trying to decapitate his opponent and feast on his heart, a long forgotten instinct remaining from the early evolutionary stages of the proto-Paranid beetle.</t>
    <t id="1031614">This sector is dominated by the sight of two interweaving nebulas in the distance. Paranid astronomers have discovered that they are annihilating each other where their matter comes together, disbanding the molecules and creating free atoms. The Priest King has already said that this is a perfect example how "everything that comes in two eventually leads to none" and that "three is the first stable composition in existence". The planets are seemingly opposites of each other - a gas giant, an ice planet and a rocky moon, they share nothing in common, but are considered as a single trinity by the Paranid priests. Young monks are now tasked to prove in a dispute how these co-existing planets and conflicting nebulas can be used as analogies for every tazura situations. So far over five thousand examples have been submitted to the Priest Council and new ones keep coming arriving every tazura. The most notable example has been named "the twin paradox", said to involve the psychology of the Paranid and lesser races. It can only be read by Paranid priests, however, so the view of lesser races on this theory is not known.</t>
    <t id="1031615">As the last of the three sectors belonging to the Heliopsaris system, it is used as an administrative centre of the new territory of the Paranid Empire. The radiation of the two suns in the system provides all planets with very hot surface temperatures, favoured by the Paranid colonists. The local shipyard is used for the production of new destroyers for the Paranid Military and no less than three mighty battleships have already been constructed here. Heavily focused on technology production, it relies on numerous supply lines from the planets as well as surrounding sectors to upkeep the production rates. Several workers have already died of overexertion, thought to be the consequence of illegal slave collars.</t>
    <t id="1031616">Deep in the centre of the Helionestrakas system, this sector is assumed to hold three planets, including the rich and hot Heliopsaris II as one of the main Paranid settlements in the new territory. With the hot climate of the planet being almost perfectly suited to the needs of the Paranid and thus completely intolerable to any other beings, plans for turning the settlement into a religious centre have already been laid out. Strict laws adhere to all unholy beings, with planetary landing strictly prohibited to non-religious Paranids without exceptions. Being the third sector claimed with all of them having three planets and the middle sector of the three sectors that are forming the Heliopsaris system, the unmistakable holiness of this location cannot be disputed. A local asteroid field covers a fair percentage of the sector, allowing for a number of high-tech installations to be built without the concern of dwindling resources.</t>
    <t id="1031617">This is the main Paranid settlement in the new territory and home of the Priest King of the Colonies. Already housing the largest city the Paranid have built so far, the sector is an industrial and spiritual hub, with authorities keeping close control on all events observed in the Paranid Expansion Region. The local moon, Heliosnackas I, seems to have suffered a collision with a meteorite. Currently split in three parts, without any sign of further dissimilation or convergence of the shattered pieces, it now forms a tertiary system that in all aspects behaves like a single celestial object. The Paranids believe that this is yet another proof of the wonders of the three-dimensionality only they can understand.</t>
    <t id="1031618">The planet Silenus was the first of the two planets inhabited by the animal-like Nugrahksve predator race. Being barely self-sentient and driven by instincts, they have not shown any advances in basic technology, and culture-wise they have barely grasped the foundations of speech, currently consisting of unarticulated groans. Therefore, it is a mystery how they came to inhabit two separate planets. A theory claims that select groups were transported by yet another race for reasons unknown. Since they have only one eye per individual and are responsible for the extinction of a three-eyed beetle species that were closely reminiscent of the Paranid proto-evolutionary stages, they are now considered as pests in need of extermination by the Paranid. Argon, Boron and Terran governments have expressed their objections against the ongoing genocide, but the grand emperor of the Paranid, Pontifex Maximus Paranidia himself, has officially warned the other races that if one of them should intervene in their purification rites, a crusade will be started immediately. As a result, the governments of the other races have turned a blind eye on the actions of the Paranid, but as a consequence, their relations with the Paranids have worsened significantly over the last two jazuras and the Paranids are no longer readily welcome in a number of stations.</t>
    <t id="1031619">Two lone uninhabited planets occupy this secluded system. As the furthest and most recent of the Paranid acquisitions, this sector houses a number of secret technological research and development labs. The focus of the ongoing research is hidden from the public, but it is known that a large number of supply ships land on the planets and that the sector consumes nearly two percent of the income generated by the whole Paranid Empire. Speculations of a new gate building project have arisen, alongside rumours of the creation of plans for new super-ships that combine the capabilities of Kha'ak destroyers and Commonwealth dreadnoughts. There is no ground or substance to these rumours, however, and it is common practice for the Paranids to create elaborate ploys to throw off other races from their real intentions.</t>

    <t id="1031708">Another system that is shown on the Melpomenia map. This system does not seem to have any abandoned colonies and only a lone wreck of a large ship was found drifting near the north gate. Its structure and layout was very similar to old Terran destroyer designs, but the living facilities seemed to be stretched to accommodate up to several thousand people at once. There was no sign of artificial damage; the nuclear fission reactor used to power all life support systems had been broken and leaked radiation into the ship. As with all other colonies, no data storage devices were found aboard the ship - a sure sign that the old Terrans who left it here didn't want anyone to know their destination. Strangely no remains of living beings were found on the ship, even though everything had been preserved perfectly in a temperature only a few degrees higher than the absolute zero. The wreck was towed to the nearest shipyard and completely disassembled. Now nothing is left in the system to mark the initial location of the wreck and the colony built on the frozen planet Nexon is a typical agricultural Terran settlement, with nothing of particular interest for an aspiring researcher, scientist or militant.</t>
    <t id="1031709">The large planet, Helicon IV, has not yet been habited. The focus of Terran colonization in the system has been turned to the large moon of Helicon IV, which has its own atmosphere, highly saturated with oxygen, nitrogen and helium. Though its surface temperature is just barely above the freezing point of water, large seas are situated near the equator. Despite the appearance of a perfect place for indigenous life, the moon had been completely empty and lifeless before the Terrans began to colonize it. Now select areas have been devoted to forests and a number of wild animals, created in order to start up a dynamic ecosystem. Habitation of Helicon IV itself is deemed impossible due to the single life form that is found all over its surface. A small bacterium grows like moss on everything that is even slightly damp, including spaceship hulls and human skin and breathing organs. The harmful bacterium can only be killed by a prolonged radiation of ultra-violet light, a small-scale solution that cannot rid the whole planet of its presence.</t>
    <t id="1031710">The bright nova, Rigel, is seen from this sector as a small bright star very close to the system's own sun, Korell. As one of the systems that had been deciphered from the Melpomenia map, it contained an old and abandoned Terran colony. A large and entirely ruined city was found on the surface of Korell IV, the bright blue planet close to the gates. All evidence collected so far shows that it had been built less than eight hundred jazuras ago and had soon been abandoned because of a planetary bombardment. No organic remains of the inhabitants have been found and no data storage modules had been left intact by the original settlers. It is still a mystery how the colonists evacuated the giant city, as there seem to be no evacuation paths and launchpads, yet there are no empty ship wrecks or bones left. By now the city has been repaired and is now inhabited once more. New colonists are often reluctant to live in the city, seeing as it had seen such an ominous fate and have built a neighbouring city a few miles away. There are very intense tides on Korell IV which are caused by the large moon in orbit which itself is circled by a smaller moon.</t>
    <t id="1031711">The main star of the system, an old red giant, is orbited by a young protostar at a large elliptic orbit. It is assumed that the protostar had once been a large gas giant that has begun its own chain of nuclear reactions due to increased heat radiation from the expanding central star. Having already burned a large percentage of its matter, the protostar is expected to burn out within a few millennia, far quicker than the expected end of the red giant. Both the planet and the Moon of the system are inhabited. Multiple administrative centres have been built on the planet and several tax reductions have made the planet a welcome destination for young colonists. The only thing that holds a lot of people off is the deep red shade that is seen on the planet at every sunrise and sunset. The already red light of the sun is forced to pass a thick layer of atmosphere which holds off the brighter tones, leaving only a rich, deep sanguine colour through which highlights everything in an unnatural blood-red tone. Some settlers have reported nervous breakdowns due to this and currently a curfew has been set on the main cities in the hope of reducing the sudden increase of insomnia sufferers, thought to be influenced by the unnatural shades.</t>
    <t id="1031712">Controlled by the Rhea Democracy, this sector is just another area that is controlled by the Terrans in any way except for the name and serves as a buffer zone between them and the Paranid Empire. Both of the planets house several Terran colonies and very few members of other species are allowed to land here. The inhabitants of the system are extremely xenophobic and are considering a full blockade of all spaceports, essentially forbidding any spacecraft from landing. The security is pretty tight in the system, with both Rhean and Terran police forces being allowed to act unhindered. No attacks have ever been staged against this colony, because it is very clear that if anything should happen here, it will claim the full attention of the whole Terran Fleet.</t>
    <t id="1031713">The twin planets of Dictynna I and II are far too cold to support Paranid settlements. Nevertheless, the Paranids have set up a small monastery on the surface of Dictynna I and are trying to send as many young priests there as possible, saying that they should feel privileged to be able to suffer in the name of the Xaar. The Xaar himself, when notified of the existence of the monastery is said to have closed the middle eye and sighed. The details may not be accurate though - the messenger was found dead the next tazura, with a ceremonial dagger jutting out of his forehead. His tomb on Paranid Prime has been encapsulated in a steel coffer that bears the mark of three snowflakes, which, incidentally, is also the new symbol of the monastery.</t>
    <t id="1031714">A dense asteroid ring surrounds the rocky planetoid of Cephalon. Large mining enterprises have already stationed their mobile mines in the outskirts of the ring, shuttling the unrefined ore down on the planet. It is said that at this rate, the Cephalon system alone could support all Paranid shipyards in the Expansion Region and the companies are currently estimating the costs of one standard ore crate to be a bit less than 9 credits. Since all of the business is owned directly by the Priest King of the Colonies, the precious minerals are never released onto the free market, even though the Teladi have tasked all of their ambassadors to try and gain the favour of the Paranids on this matter. Their current offer is to buy the ore at 47.954 credits per crate, but the Paranids have not even responded to their attempts at bargaining. While the system does have four other planets, none of them show large traces of any minerals, thus the Paranid are in full control of the system's resources.</t>

    <t id="1031717">The 3rd Grand Paranid Missionary Fleet had explored this sector and were almost ready to leave when a stray scan lead them to perhaps one of the most important discoveries of this time. A sea with simple single-cell silicon-based bacteria near the shores was found on the dark side of the planet. These bacteria share the genes of normal life forms, except that all carbon compounds are substituted by nearly identical silicon molecules. They are thought to be an example of the first evolutionary stages of life itself. In an unusual bid, the Paranids have allowed select teams of scientists from the Boron and Teladi races to reside near the sea on special anti-grav platforms, in order to explore and monitor the actual evolution of life without actually setting foot on the planet itself. They are surrounded by a military escort at all times, and anyone who sets off on to the surface of the planet is killed immediately. Despite the interesting content, the sector is now a quiet and remote place with only moderate civilian traffic and no strategic importance.</t>
    <t id="1031718">This sector has only recently discovered. A Paranid recon corvette entered it, chasing two desperate pirate ships. Three out of five planets show traces of ancient, yet still barely functional infrastructure. All of it is submerged below the sea level. The protective fields seem to have failed jazuras ago, and everything is now flooded. The Paranids did not encounter any automated defences and scanning did not reveal even the slightest traces of life. It is not known whether this is an old and forgotten Terran colony or something entirely different.</t>

    <t id="1031811">This sector is caught within an eternal dawn, as the planet and the moon always keep just above the direct line from the sun to the sector. Neither of the two is habitable, though the Terrans are trying to build sealed geodesic domes on the moon that can support a large population. So far, their efforts have been moderately successful and only two major cities have been established deep below the surface of the planet. The large gas giant seems to consist of highly toxic gases, a fair share of which are swept off by inertial forces and later captured by the moon's own gravity. What little atmosphere it has is now completely lethal to any living being, containing various poison fumes and radioactive isotopes. Landing on the moon is a complicated procedure, as the Terrans have not permitted slow landing procedures here. All ships must rush directly into the several kilometre deep landing port at their top speed in order to minimize the time of exposure to the radioactive atmosphere. Several ships have crashed during landing due to hull corrosion caused by the acidic droplets floating just above the surface.</t>

    <t id="1031814">One of the rarest, and, according to the Paranid priests, holiest sights can be found in this system. Three suns shed their light on the planets, a celestial arrangement the Paranid consider as a site of utmost brilliance. The binary stars Crius and Coetus orbit each other very closely and are at distance barely distinguishable, while Dione is situated a lot further out and is only barely affected by the gravity fields of the binary system. The grand Paranid leader, Pontifex Maximus Paranidia, is said to visit this sector secretly in the following jazura. Grand monasteries have already been built on all five planets in the system, complete with luxurious astronomical facilities. More than a hundred Paranid priests have permanently damaged their vision by trying to look at all three stars at once with three telescopes without any protection. Though blind, they claim that they have been enlightened and now understand all of the intricacies of the three dimensions of space.</t>
    <t id="1031815">The spectacular rings of the planet Edosocknatas are considered sacred by the Paranid. It is said that upon seeing them the first time, illuminated in the twin light of the system's two suns, the admiral of the 3rd Grand Paranid Missionary Fleet ordered every ship to take a well-earned tazura for rest. The actual reason for the pause may be different though - the small moon of Edonckas was populated by the vicious Nugrahksve race, a race of barely self-sentient one-eyed animals that the Paranid have labelled as unholy and on whose extinction they are working diligently. The reason for this aggression is quite complicated - the Paranid exploration teams found remains of a three-eyed species of beetles that inhabited the moon. The carnivorous Nugrahksve creatures had savagely attacked and eliminated all of these beetles. Enraged by the annihilation of species so closely resembling their own pre-evolutionary stages, the Paranid announced a holy crusade against the Nugrahksve. Now no Nugrahksve creatures exist anymore on this moon, but it is littered with a number of craters caused by the impact blasts of the Paranid bombardment. No signs of inhabitance are left on the moon, in fact, no signs of anything but barren wasteland now remain on the moon - a sure proof that the Paranid are pitiless towards their enemies.</t>
    <t id="1031816">The star of this system is estimated to be one of the oldest existing stars in the whole Expansion Region. Now nearing the end of its life, it is emitting a fierce blue light and very little warmth. The light is captured by the atmosphere of the gas giant, illuminating it in rich blue tones. The sight was deemed pleasing by the Paranid priests, though they expressed their sorrow that it had not formed in threes. They take consolation in the fact that the atmosphere is divided in three distinct layers, each acquiring a different shade of blue, and upholding the Paranid religious beliefs of the holiness of everything concerning the number three. The sector itself is situated close to a rich asteroid field and plans of large-scale mining are being made by several companies.</t>
    <t id="1031817">This system is regarded as the most perfect location of the whole Expansion Region. Three bright large suns have formed in the blue nebula and now illuminate the sector and the two planets with, as the Paranid claim, divine purifying light. The planets are now revered as holy themselves and only the wealthiest of the Paranid colonists are allowed to reside in the sector. Space stations face no such regulations yet, but they are known to be routinely inspected by special teams to ensure that they uphold the Sacred Law of Three active. It is known that the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia has already visited the sector covertly.</t>

    <t id="1031918">An automated recon drone, sent on a mission to map the neighbouring Sector 1716, discovered the gate to this system by accident. It appears to have two large, completely water-covered planets. The planets themselves have developed infrastructure, even though all of it now seems to lie in disrepair and ruin. There is a single ice asteroid in the centre of the sector, and faint automated signals seem to originate from it at regular intervals. The code is cryptic and long forgotten, but special teams of scientists have discovered that a small segment of it reads "--Atlantis---...---".</t>

    <t id="10021">The Boron are famous for their wisdom, wealth and the sophistication of their space ships throughout the X Universe. Boron ships have a shimmering green tint to them. They are equipped with powerful engines and are among the fastest and most manoeuvrable ships in the universe. They are also armed with very sophisticated weapons and defensive shields and, with the exception of the Argon, are among the best spacecraft you can buy.\n\nBecause of their peaceful nature the Boron are friends to all races in the X Universe despite their membership in the Foundation Guild and their strong alliance with the Argon. They currently hold trading agreements with both the Teladi and the Paranid, however, they are still very wary of the Split and relationships between the two races are strained.\n\nThe Boron have no direct contact with the Xenon, however, because of their relationship with the Argon, they are very much aware of them and of the threat they represent. Despite being called the Kingdom of Boron, they are actually ruled by an elected government. They do however have a royal family who act as figureheads of the Kingdom State.\n\nThe current head of this Royal Family is the 50-jazuras-old Queen Atreus. Her husband, King Rolk, was killed in a space cruiser when it crash-landed on a nearby space station, leaving their daughter, Princess Menelaus, as the heir apparent.</t>
    <t id="10031">To this tazura the Split continue to control large territories that used to belong to the kingdom of Boron. They continue to exploit the rare Markus Spacefly as a propellant in their ships, but they also continue to effectively trade with the Profit Guild. While the relationship between the Foundation Guild and the Profit Guild remains cordial, on the surface anyway, the relationship between the Split and the other races is continually degenerating and now borders on the edge of war. This due equally to the natural aggressiveness of the Split and the continued abuse of the Markus Spacefly.\n\nEven though the Boron are a peaceful race, they are always eager to reclaim their lost territories and don't miss any opportunity to attack the Split. The Argon are suspicious of the Split's alleged friendship with the Xenon even though the Split and Xenon barely tolerate each other. They were at war at one time, but when neither side could see an easy victory or any territory to be gained, they came to terms. However, this treaty is very shaky and a new war is expected if their association deteriorates much further. The Split maintain a frosty friendship with the Paranid, but will never forgive them for not engaging in the fight against the Xenon when the Split needed them.</t>
    <t id="10061">Today, the Xenon are somewhat of an enigma. There is no known contact between the Xenon and any other race. They do not belong to any of the guilds. They do not use Credits nor is it known what, if any, currency they use. They appear to have no interest in the technology of or to trade with other races. The location of the Xenon home planet, if there is one, has never been discovered in spite of many attempts to do so. Nor does anyone know the exact size of the territory that the Xenon control. Hence, on most star maps, possible Xenon sectors are only marked with a question mark and a warning to be cautious. Not many ships dare venture into these regions of space and, regrettably, many ships brave enough to do so have never been heard from again. The Xenon, if the robot psychologists are to be believed, seem to be ever increasing in self awareness, consciousness and understanding of themselves. Whether this development is a step in the right direction is still undecided since the Xenon continue to attack first and don't bother asking questions afterwards.\n\nA special covert operations department of the Argon Federation Space Academy based on Argon Prime has researched the Xenon for many jazuras and is currently engaged in documenting and cross referencing all confirmed Xenon ship sightings. Unnamed sources inside the department suggest that there are plans to finance an undercover expedition deep into the Xenon territory in an attempt to locate the Xenon home world.</t>
    <t id="10071">The Kha'ak is a hive race in which the individual only exists to serve the hive. A Kha'ak will sacrifice himself to that end without question. The Kha'ak's goal appears to be the destruction of the universe. They employ a cluster configuration in which their interceptors, scouts and fighters group together and break apart at will in order to better engage the enemy. Despite their increasing presence in the universe there is still very little known about them; their origin, how many of them there are or what their true intentions are, although there are rumours linking them with Nividium.\n\nIt is interesting to observe how Kha'ak ships behave. If you have ever seen a flock of birds suddenly change direction you might agree that it's an amazing sight. Kha'ak fighters emulate this behaviour when they chase a patrol ship. Once their target is destroyed they will turn as one and take on their next victim. You may see this yourself one tazura and your reaction will change very quickly from fascinated amazement to gut-wrenching horror when you realize that you are their next chosen victim. The Kha'ak turn everyone and everything they encounter into space debris. They take no prisoners.</t>
    <t id="10091">Seven hundred jazuras in the past, Earth colonists were trapped in the X-Universe. They made a new home on the planet now known as Argon Prime. At the same time, the terraforming Xenon machines took over the sectors east of President's End. Most of these became Pirate sectors after the Xenon war.\n\nThe Argon called the colonists Gunners, naming them after their leader, Nathan R. Gunne who explored the universe in an effort to find a way back to Earth. The details of their story became obscured in the centuries that followed and became known as The Truth. Even their name became distorted and they became known as the Goners. The Goners worked in harmony with the Argon and spread the "good news" about the existence of a glorious planet called Earth to other races.\n\nGoners use the "Book of Truth" as their spiritual and philosophical guide and in their temple they have "Beholders of the Truth". Their leader is Noah Gaffelt, an old man with a white beard. Norma Gardna, a noted female Beholder of the Truth and second in command, died on Argon Prime due to a sickness and was replaced by Lynda North. The "Book of Truth" is said to contain extensive knowledge about Earth, which has found itself in high demand due to recent events.</t>
