  <t id="250600">Fatal incident in {sector.name@L2M505.OfferSector}</t>
  <t id="250601">Recently a heavily damaged {object.race.name@L2M505.Station} ship was safely brought home by a merchant named \033W{player.name}\033X during a heroic rescue mission. By risking his own ship and his life, this pilot saved a great deal more than just one of our most important vessels. The {object.race.name@L2M505.Station} are very grateful and wish to thank the noble pilot who showed us the true meaning of honour.</t>
  <t id="250602">During a hapless attempt to rescue a {object.race.name@L2M505.Station} vessel, the pilot \033W{player.name}\033X failed as it took him too long to reach the {object.name@L2M505.Station} in \033W{sector.name@L2M505.DestSector}\033X. Before he reached them, the stricken ship's reactor containment field breached and caused an immense explosion from which no one survived. We mourn the loss of so many innocent lives.</t>
  <t id="250603">During an ill-fated attempt to rescue a {object.race.name@L2M505.Station} vessel, the pilot {player.name} failed in his efforts to do so as the ship he had promised to protect was destroyed during the mission. We mourn the loss of many innocent lives.</t>
  <t id="250604">We can now confirm the reports that a ruthless pilot going by the name of \033W{player.name}\033X recently attacked a heavily damaged {object.race.name@L2M505.Station} vessel in sector \033W{sector.name@L2M505.OfferSector}\033X. They showed no mercy and destroyed the ship without reason killing the entire crew onboard. The {object.race.name@L2M505.Station} will never forget this crime. If you see this bloody bastu out there in space, do what you have to and protect yourself!\n</t>
  <t id="250605">During an attempt to rescue a heavily damaged {object.name@{param@ShipName}} in sector \033W{sector.name@L2M505.OfferSector}\033X, the pilot \033W{player.name}\033X failed in his mission because his final destination {object.name@L2M505.Station} had been destroyed. The {object.race.name@L2M505.Station} tragically could not manage to get to a repair facility before its reactor exploded. We mourn the loss of so many innocent lives.</t>
  <t id="250606">The pilot \033W{player.name}\033X failed in an attempt to rescue a {object.race.name@L2M505.Station} vessel. At this very moment we have no further information but we will let you know when we have more news. Our thoughts are with the survivors of the tragedy.</t>
  <t id="250607">As you might have heard already, an incompetent pilot going by the name of \033W{player.name}\033X has destroyed a heavily damaged {object.name@L2M505.OfferShip} with all hands in sector \033W{object.name@L2M505.OfferSector}\033X during an ill-fated towing attempt with a tractor beam. It appears that there had been insufficient communication between the pilot and the crew of the stranded ship and so the gravity stabilizers had not been fully engaged before \033W{player.name}\033X started his engines and tore the ship apart. All he had to do was talk, nothing more! If you see this bloody bastu out there in space, don't communicate with him... it seems he doesn't believe in it either.</t>
  <t id="250608">We call pilot \033W{player.name}\033X a worthless chicken! It seems this individual does not have the capacity to show respect for neither life nor property. He rejected all calls for help from the crew aboard a stricken {object.race.name@L2M505.Station} vessel in sector \033W{sector.name@L2M505.OfferSector}\033X. All he had to do was tow the stranded ship back home, but he couldn't be bothered!\n\nAttention! If {player.name} asks for your help at any time, you know what not to do...\n\n</t>
  <t id="250699">The mission to rescue the immobile ship was not completed. For confidential reasons the contract has been aborted, thank you for your assistance.</t>

  <t id="2600013">A pirate clan is using a mining outpost as a secret base for their criminal activities. We need you to dock at the station, talk to our agent and then return here without being discovered.</t>

  <t id="2600015">The job does not pay that much, only 3000 credits. However, if you are successful, we can offer you much more profitable work. Do you want the job?</t>

We finally got the clearance to do something about them.\nSadly neither the sector security forces nor the military can deal with them anytime soon.\nThat's why we decided to hire freelancers. You will be provided with a flight route which will take\nyou to the area in {sector.name@XTM Generic Mission 004.ActionSector} where the pirate ships have been sighted lately.\nYour mission is simple.

  <t id="3500102">I've never seen a failure like this! This is a catastrophe! You let way too many of them escape. This will encourage them to raid us again! Forget the payment! You can feel lucky that we don't make you pay up for the damage you've done!</t>
  <t id="3500103">Hey, what gives? We had a pretty basic deal, you and I! You were supposed to go where I told you to go, right now, and you said you would, but I am not seeing you there! Forget the deal, if you can't sort out basic navigation, then turn to planetside farming, kid!</t>

  <!--GNS in pirate sectors article-->
  <t id="3510011">The latest raid against our targets in {sector.name@L2M003XTC.MissionSector} was an utter failure! Based on their performance, we are ashamed to call the family involved in the assault a clan, they would seem to be no better than mere slaves!\n\nThanks to their stellar defeat, we are now left with a ruined reputation. How can we extort station owners when they think we're such pushovers? But rest assured brethren, for our end is not nigh. The responsible clan has been dealt with, and the names of mercenaries who aided in defending the sector from our little operation have been noted and distributed amongst the bounty hunters. They will be tracked down and vengeance shall be ours.\n\nPirate Rhb t'Nkkst</t>
  <t id="3510012">The latest operation against our enemies in {sector.name@L2M003XTC.MissionSector} was a complete success! We are more than proud to call the pirate clan involved in the raid a true family with proud piracy traditions running deep in their blood! For their efforts, they have gained great renown among our brethren.\n\nThe final result was greater than we could have anticipated, more than 17 new station owners have accepted our protection services, and they will now provide much needed financial aid for our cause. Of course, some lives were lost in the assault, and no true pirate will allow the death of his brothers to stay unpunished. Our spies in the area have noted the names of all non-military combat ships involved, as well as their deeds and number of our folk slain. Our greater collective will issue a bounty on their heads, ensuring a swift vengeance.\n\nPirate Rhb t'Nkkst</t>

  <t id="3510003">Sector is protected from pirate raiders!</t>
  <t id="3510004">Pirates successfully assault a whole sector!</t>
  <!--GNS in offer race sectors article-->
  <t id="3510013">A long planned pirate raid was successfully neutralised in {sector.name@L2M003XTC.MissionSector}. It seems that the pirates of a well-known clan had chosen the sector as a place for both warning and punishment. They warned the station owners what would happen if they didn't pay for so-called 'protection', and then punished those that refused to pay.\n\nThat was the plan at least, but luckily the invasion was dealt with in a swift and decisive manner. A local station manager realising that military ships calling for defence of the sector would not be able to arrive in time, issued a call for help on the regular communication channel. By chance, several mercenaries picked up the signal and agreed to hold off the pirate raiders until the arrival of the military forces. The defence was successful, and although there were heavy casualties on both sides, the captain of the defending military fleet reported that all of the mercenaries had acted as real professionals, and that everyone should be proud to fly in the same space that these brave men traverse.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News</t>
  <t id="3510014">Unfortunately, we have to bring bad news to our readers. A pirate fleet recently entered {sector.name@L2M003XTC.MissionSector} and devastated everything there simply to show their might and influence over the area. The local military force commander said that he was aware of the impending raid, but there was no chance whatsoever for him to make it to the combat zone in time to prevent civilian casualties.\n\nThe most unfortunate part of this is that the death of hundreds of civilians could have been prevented, if only more mercenaries had responded to the emergency call for help issued just before the assault. Analysts claim that the pirates gained the upper hand by pure chance, and if there had even been just one more mercenary willing to defend, the whole invasion could have been prevented and the pirates would never have had the chance to escape with their lives. Now, we are left with only one question. Are there really no more heroes in the space lanes? What has happened to the fabled freelancers, pilots of exceptional skill and combat prowess? Are they now just mere illusions of past times? This event appears to give us only one glaringly painful answer... yes.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News</t>
