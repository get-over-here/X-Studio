        <t id="100000">Starship Drive : Chemical Drive</t>
        <t id="100001">The chemical drive is the most basic of all
propulsion systems that are known to work in zero gravity environments. It
is based on an exothermic reaction that occurs when two usually inert
compounds are introduced to each other in special circumstances, like
increased pressure or temperature. Chemical drives were initially used on
all early spacecraft, but they were soon made redundant by newer
technologies that did not require large amounts of chemical compounds to be
carried as fuel in order to continue sustained engine operation. The
chemical drive however is being reintroduced nowadays as a cheap alternative
propulsion system for devices that are not capable of carrying a plasma
generator and have short flight duration, like missiles and automated short
range drones.</t>
        <t id="100002">Starship Drive : Plasma Drive</t>
        <t id="100003">The plasma drive propulsion system uses the high
energy obtained from ionized plasma that is created in a compact fusion
reactor to create physical reactive thrust. The plasma drive is capable of
producing up to fifty times more energy than what can be created with a
chemical drive system, rendering it far more efficient as a thrust
generator. The modern plasma drives do not contain the design flaws and
errors of the early models and are now considered to be the safest and
easiest to maintain of all propulsion systems. The vast majority of existing
spacecraft make use of the plasma drive; they can be noticed from a distance
due to the colourful trails their engines leave behind whilst in operation.
The specific colour is determined by the type of resource that the fusion
reactor uses as a fuel source.</t>
        <t id="100004">Starship Drive : Ion Drive</t>
        <t id="100005">This is a newly developed technology that makes use
of the tiny impulses created by accelerating ionised gases to high
velocities via a magnetic field stabiliser. Ionized gases can be obtained in
a multitude of ways, with two being widely used in conventional ion drives.
One way is to use electron bombardment to ionize the gas; the other is to
pass an output from a standard fusion core through a static electric field
in order to separate the positive and negative charged particles and
accelerate them. This results in a hybrid system that uses both ion drive
and plasma drive technology. This hybrid is not as effective as a pure ion
drive, but it is still a considerable improvement over the basic plasma
drive and capable of generating up to twice the thrust with no additional
fuel consumption. The principal component of the ion drive is a particle
accelerator that accelerates the ions to velocities only marginally slower
than the speed of light to provide a sizeable thrust increase. It is a
stable, powerful and efficient technology, but it does take up considerable
space, so it is only installed in very large vessels. Currently most Terran
capital ships use accelerated ion drives, while the Commonwealth capital
ships have been fitted with hybrid drives.</t>
        <t id="101000">Power Generator : Fission Reactor</t>
        <t id="101001">Nuclear fission reactors generate power by bombarding
heavy atom nuclei with free neutrons, initiating a nuclear collapse and the
creation of two light metal atoms. A large amount of free energy is released
during this process. Fission reactors were outlawed in the year 603 [Earth
year 2773] due to their numerous shortcomings. The Uranium and Plutonium
isotopes, which are used as fuel for the reactor, are quite rare, expensive
and dangerous. In its active operating state, the fission reactor produces
vast amounts of radioactive waste and requires constant and precise
monitoring. Even the slightest misbalance can lead to a core meltdown, an
event where the superheated core literally burns through its protective
casing in the direction of the nearest gravity well or opposite to the
direction of acceleration due to its own inertia. The fission reactor has
been replaced by fusion power cores or smaller fusion batteries widely known
as energy cells.</t>
        <t id="101002">Power Generator : Fusion Reactor</t>
        <t id="101003">This device generates power by initiating a fusion of
two light nuclei in order to create one that is heavier. Hydrogen isotopes
are usually the preferred type of light nuclei, due to their natural
abundance and harmlessness to living beings. The fusion reactor creates far
more energy than the fission reactor for an equal amount of fuel used and
creates no radioactive waste at all. Fusion plasma, which is the form that
the resulting free energy takes, is highly conductive and therefore is
commonly used for various energetic devices, like weapons and ship
propulsion systems. It is a key component in the widely utilised plasma
drive system. Fusion reactors are widespread throughout the universe in two
major forms, one being a large fusion power core and the other, a small
fusion battery which is also known as an energy cell.</t>
        <t id="101004">Power Generator : Matter/Antimatter Reactor</t>
        <t id="101005">This reactor combines matter and antimatter particles
to create energy which is released from their mass when they collide and
annihilate each other. This energy can then be used for various purposes,
one of them being plasma generation. The reactor is an advanced device that
requires precise magnetic and gravitational field manipulators to keep the
matter and antimatter from colliding prematurely and to channel the
resulting energy away from the annihilation point. The flow of antimatter
has to be exactly controlled using only miniscule quantities; if a large
amount of antimatter broke free and combined with regular matter, the
resulting reaction would be capable of destroying an area of several cubic
parsecs and potentially damaging the very fabric of space. This technology
is only used on large experimental ship designs that can handle the demands
of the antimatter containment systems.</t>
        <t id="101006">Power Generator : Quantum Singularity Engine</t>
        <t id="101007">This technology exploits the destructive power of a
trapped black hole. Using an advanced gravitational field technology, an
artificial quantum singularity is created and any matter introduced into it
is destroyed, resulting in a release of pure energy. This technology only
uses half the amount of fuel that the matter/antimatter reactor requires and
is not limited by any specific fuel type. The only by-product that this
device creates is antimatter which can be further used in weapon systems or
as a secondary power source. Since the created singularity is artificial, it
will simply collapse upon a breach, resulting in a single and final
antimatter burst and nothing else. This technology is only used by the
Terran Federation to power their engines and weapon systems, and it is
incompatible with Commonwealth technology. There are reports that the
Kha’ak ships use a similar technology on their capital ships.</t>
        <t id="101008">Power Generator : Quantum Subspace Tap</t>
        <t id="101009">This is a purely theoretical technology only recently
proposed in jumpdrive research laboratories. This unique device would draw
energy directly from subspace through an unconnected jump portal. The energy
supply would be completely limitless, generated by fluctuations of tidal
subspace currents which are amplified by other objects traversing through
hyperspace. It is not known how energy would be collected and transmitted,
and the nearest working prototype of this technology won’t be created for
at least three hundred years. It is speculated that this type of technology
was probably used by the Ancients. A very crude form of this technology has
been found on Kha’ak capital craft as well, and recent experimental ship
designs have incorporated retrofitted Kha’ak subspace taps into prototype
power generators.</t>
        <t id="102000">Technology : Jumpgates</t>
        <t id="102001">Jumpgates can send any object across vast distances
in a matter of seconds through a tunnel that transcends regular space. It is
created by folding space and creating a hyperspace passageway, also known as
the tunnel or wormhole. It is claimed that hyperspace is another physical
dimension that does not adhere to the laws of time and distance. The gate
network that forms the X-Universe was built by an ancient alien race, which
is known only as the Ancients. They are known to keep an eye on the network
and have reconnected the tunnels to allow all sentient races to leave their
home worlds and colonize other planets and systems. The gates seem to have
an on-board memory that determines the final destination of the contained
tunnel. They can be reset and locked onto other gates, but this practice is
highly dangerous, as the gate cannot differentiate between various
hyperspace openings and they are liable to lock onto naturally created
wormholes or even a black hole. This theory was proven to be true during an
experimental reconnection of the recently discovered 'Hub' - this
unfortunately locked onto a black hole and then automatically cut all other
active connections to maintain the integrity of the tunnel. Researchers have
determined that a maximum of six gates can operate within a single spherical
light second; any additional gate may cause a permanent uncontrollable rift
in the fabric of the three-dimensional space.</t>
        <t id="102002">Technology : Jumpdrive</t>
        <t id="102003">The jumpdrive operates by creating a personal
wormhole which is forced to lock onto an already existing hyperspace tunnel
entry, usually contained within a jumpgate. The on-board computer of any
ship has access to the coordinates of all gates it has crossed and is
capable of transferring these coordinates to the jumpdrive. When opened, a
weak hyperspace link only exists for mere milliseconds, which is just enough
time for a ship to cross the intersection and enter the relatively secure
tunnel between two gates. For a few nanoseconds, while the ship is still in
the temporary link, it is vulnerable to any interference. Long range jumps
produced a problem for the scientists that developed the jumpdrive system as
it became clear that locking onto a distant gate even for milliseconds would
require energy bursts that cannot be produced by conventional ship energy
generators. Though larger ships could produce more energy, their increased
mass meant that the link had to be more stable and this in turn required
even more energy. It was only later that scientists developed a way for
disposable energy cells to create the short and rapid pulse of energy
required for the jump. A unified energy transfer system was soon adopted,
and it was determined that a safe traverse of one gate required the combined
power of five energy cells for even the smallest of spaceships to create a
durable working link to the nearest tunnel.</t>
        <t id="102004">Technology : Gateless Jumpdrive</t>
        <t id="102005">This system was first used in the prototype vessel
named the 'X-Shuttle'. Unlike conventional jumpdrives that create an
intersecting link to an existing hyperspace tunnel, the gateless jumpdrive
allows for the creation of a temporary artificial wormhole that is focused
independently of any existing gates. The device creates a microscopic
wormhole during the charging period. Once the micro-wormhole is established
and confirmed to be secure, the energy from the energy cells is released
into the point generator which expands the micro-wormhole to traversable
size and establishes a conventional hyperspace tunnel. The drive systems by
design need precise spatial coordinates for the calculation and projection
of the exit point. As with the jumpgates, the exit point can be intercepted
by natural wormholes and black holes as well as other deactivated jumpgates.
The travelling object can also be thrown off course by subspace tidal waves,
a problem that does not occur to the shielded tunnels maintained by the
gates. It is believed that the Kha’ak use a very similar system to conduct
their jumps. It has been noticed that their smaller ships are unable to jump
by themselves and have to form a cluster group to achieve the power required
for the jump. It is not known how they plot their course and project the
exit points.</t>
        <t id="102006">Technology : Tractor Beam</t>
        <t id="102007">With numerous accidents experienced using physical
grappling hook techniques, Argon scientists have recently developed a new
technology for ship and station towing, called the 'Tractor Beam'. It is
based on gravitational manipulation, greatly lessening the inertia and
perceived mass of the target object as well as introducing its own pull
force vectors. It has been designed to work with the jump gates, but the
implementation is still relatively unrefined, therefore it is crucial to
know how towed ships will react when passing through a jump gate. To
successfully traverse hyperspace, one must cross the event horizon of the
gate at a speed no greater than 80m/s. Once on the other side, it is
advisable to come to a complete halt and simply wait for the other ship to
come through. If you choose to fly away or engage the autopilot, the tractor
beam may collapse and cause damage to both your ship and the target vessel.
The tractor beam will eventually lock itself on the target automatically,
but it is known that this automated connection can often be faulty and will
break upon the slightest strain. It is advised always to approach the target
ship and reduce speed to 0m/s and then slowly accelerate away, keeping a
close watch on the tractor beam connection. If it breaks, you will have to
reconnect it manually once more. Due to safety precautions, factories cannot
be pulled through gates, and the tractor beam control systems will
automatically terminate any connection if you engage your jumpdrive.</t>
