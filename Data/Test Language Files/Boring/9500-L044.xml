		<t id="102">Being the gateway to our newest region of space, \033WAldrin\033X is by far the most discussed sector in the Expansion Region. Along with the Terrans and the Argon, many races traverse this magnificent haven of economical might. One particular group of people however, namely the Goners, use this sector as a place for spreading their beliefs. After losing reputation with just about every race due to an unfortunate incident a few mazuras ago, they have tried very hard recently to keep their metaphorical heads above water.\n\nFlyers and handouts at the local trading stations are just two of the means they use to boost their popularity and numbers of followers. After getting off to a bad start with this, they moved on to placing advertisements on the side of freighters in the false hope of grabbing the public's attention. Once again, after this had failed they then tried spreading the 'word' through their old means of hailing every ship they encounter. Predictably, most of the passing vessels usually just ignore them. Even the fun-loving Boron folk have been heard on occasion to curse the Goners for their persistence. Needless to say, the Goners have not given up on the message they believe they are obliged to spread. It was last reported that the Goner High Priest \033WNoah\033X \033WGaffelt\033X himself was entertaining the idea of going on a preaching pilgrimage. Further updates to this story will be brought to you once we hear more.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="111">Xenon probe found with ancient Earth drawings</t>
		<t id="112">The Xenon have always been of key interest to every known race in the universe. After the colonisers had finally destroyed the Xenon fleets that had overrun the initially discovered sectors in the Expansion Region, they all but disappeared from that area of space completely. This type of behaviour from the Xenon was completely unexpected, until then they had always been infamous for their aggressive expansion and relentless focus on the conquest of new territories. This left Xenologists confused as to their plans, whereabouts and the only other significant evidence of further Xenon activity until recently was a small probe that had been discovered on a remote Ore Mine. As the drills bored down into the surface of this particular asteroid, the miners came across an object that was marked with old Terraformer logos on one side. Scientists from a nearby Argon Space Facility have been studying the probe, with the help of local Goner priests, to determine what the meaning of the inscriptions and unique symbols on the probe casing might possibly be. One drawing was described like so: "A creature of some kind with two large ears and a small tail protruding from the rear". The second was of "another creature with smaller ears and a larger tail, but the whole mass of this creature was greater than the first."\n\nScientists and priests believe the drawings to be some kind of ancient symbol embodying hope and peace whilst others believe them to be of a more amusing nature. To resolve the situation, the Goners invited the venerable Terran archaeologist \033WHenry\033X \033WSvenson\033X to come and inspect the drawings. His comments were less informative and more humorous than what the Goners had hoped for. According to \033WSvenson\033X, the drawings were representations of an ancient Earth story known as 'Tom and Jerry'; his Grandfather had related this to him as a child whilst reminiscing about old mono-dimensional videos.\n\nThe Goners are disappointed with this revelation but still remain hopeful that one tazura, they too will find something of a more profound meaning, despite many jazuras of nothing. Why these drawings were on the side of a Xenon probe were is still a mystery.\n\nJason McReary - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="122">You must have heard of Insurance? In the most devious way possible, insurance companies will bleed you dry, down to the last single credit floating around in your virtual wallet. If you need insurance for a scout ship and up, you must first have a legitimate identification number with the relevant paperwork to go along with it. They need to know who you are, where you're from, how old you are and what your age is \(despite this actually being the same thing\), who your grandparents are, who was your great uncle twice removed on your mother's side, and the list goes on and on. Not only that, but think of the time wasted trying to claim money back from them. Stazuras and stazuras spent complaining to the CEO and talking to his secretary. Then add to that the stazuras spent waiting whilst they "contact their legal department" to find out whether it was your fault that "a Teladi parked his station transporter outside your front door." The time spent is often not worth the payout!\n\nInvented by the Teladi, there even now exists a type of insurance policy to cover you for attending Teladi trading conventions - "Safety Whilst Attending Teladi Conventions" \(SWATC\). It simply protects the policy holder against being tricked out of money whilst attending such a convention. At first glance, this policy seems to be nothing more than a ploy to extract even more credits from anyone with half a brain. But the one thing the Teladi never noticed, until recently, was a giant loophole that created a vortex of a liability in their policy. One section of it was worded like this: "The terms therein, identify the holder of this policy to be able to claim an unlimited amount of money in compensation." Clever legal minds quickly noticed this misworded condition and have been able to subsequently claim billions of Credits under the SWATC policy.\n\nThe \033WTeladi\033X \033WInsurance\033X \033WCompany\033X originally intended the statement to be worded like this: "The terms therein, identify the holder of this policy to be able to claim an unspecified amount of money in compensation", but as noted above, the actual wording indicated that the holder could claim an unlimited amount from the company. Other sections of the policy also indicated that the holder could submit claims for as little as one credit in losses. But from the miswording of that single line, lawyers have made billions in claims, alleging to have been conned at Teladi Conventions and then pointing to their legal rights set out in the document, requesting millions back. Needless to say, the \033WTeladi\033X \033WInsurance\033X \033WCompany\033X is now fighting numerous legal cases to recover what they have lost on this so far.\n\nIt is unclear why or how such a vital mistake could have been made. To date, no Teladi official has spoken on behalf of the company about this calamity and they have refused to put any response in writing. This is understandable, since they would most likely misquote themselves in any case.\n\nWarren Brass - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="131">Spaceweed addict claims to have seen Paranid-Split child</t>
		<t id="132">\033WInolamos\033X \033WSitiraras\033X \033WOlisbos\033X \033WI\033X claimed to local officials this morning to have seen a Split and Paranid mixed race child. This news came as a shock to the local law enforcers as it has never been heard of before, nor thought physically possible. Inolamos Sitiraras Olisbos I witnessed the half Split, half Paranid child on a local moon near a planet in \033WAtropos\033X \033WVI\033X whilst making "legal transactions" with another Teladi merchant, later identified to be a small-time drug trader. The child ran past, or more accurately into, \033WInolamos\033X \033WSitiraras\033X \033WOlisbos\033X \033WI\033X as he was handing over a "package" of some kind. The other Teladi trader, who wished to remain anonymous, also verified the incident to local law enforcers this morning, though the police suspect that he merely used this lucky chance to avoid punishment for unauthorised dealing.\n\nThe Paranid Government officials, along with the Split, are furious at this insulting slander cast against their respective races. They vowed to the people of the Expansion Region that if such a child existed, "the abomination and its perpetrators would be removed from existence", quoting the Paranid High Priest \033WKetckamanckaslt\033X. At the moment, the local law enforcers are concerned only for the child's welfare and so therefore a search for them has been commenced immediately. All the other parents in the local area are hoping for the best of course and are waiting for this mutant to be caught and put on public display. On a slightly more humorous note however, the local Teladi drunkards are already creating jokes about this unusual occurrence. One was quoted as saying, "...if the child exists and is indeed a half Paranid, half Split child, would such a creature be known as a Parit or Splinid?"\n\nWe have contacted countless genetic scientists of all races, and none of them believed that such a child can exist. We await a reply from the law enforcers for more information.\n\nSusan Brand - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="141">Update to Teladi claim of seeing half Split, half Paranid child</t>
		<t id="142">Local law enforcers have confirmed this tazura that the widely celebrated half Paranid, half Split child sighting was a hoax. This in some respects was already expected, and the two Teladi drug addicts have been taken into custody for giving deliberately false information to officers of the law. No one however has foreseen the ongoing ramifications from this fake story.\n\nAlthough the Split have so far succeeded in staying relatively calm with only 27 threats of death being sent to the Teladi police office, the Paranid alas don't even share as little common sense as that, apparently. The local Grand Priest Duke has filed an official interspecies lawsuit on the grounds of a serious slander against the whole of the Paranid race. The Teladi Corporation itself is the target of the lawsuit, and the price for appeasement is quoted to be at \033Y975.13\033X billion credits. The Teladi CEO has not commented on this turn of events, but a subordinate director did say that it was rather strange how the sum of money is exactly twice as large as the personal debt of the aforementioned Paranid Duke, implying that he may be just acting out of opportunity and striking while the wound was open. "Not that that's a bad way of doing business in itself," he quickly added. Should this lawsuit be brought to court, GalNet News will keep you informed.\n\nLangley Swarok - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="151">What's that coming over the landfill? Is it a moon or star?</t>
		<t id="152">A local planet in \033WScct's\033X \033WDespair\033X has been found to be too overly burdened with household waste. Landfill after landfill was recorded with unbelievably high mountains of filth and common trash. The piles were so high in fact, that locals living nearby could not see their moon rising until several stazuras after dark.\n\nBecause gases rising from the disgusting trash mix with leaked radiation from highly concentrated plasma canisters, the local residents find it hard to distinguish between their moon rising and the local sun. The gas causes the light from both celestial bodies to be condensed to such a great degree that it is hard to see any colour through it. This does however intriguingly make solar eclipses rather easy to observe, without fear of damage to sensitive optical sensors and unprotected eyes. Even though these eclipses only occur once in every two millennial jazuras, the residents look forward to their children enjoying this amazing phenomena.\n\nThe landfills have been left for the time being until the residents of the planet decide whether or not to vaporise them for the good of their own health. The local Government has refused official comment on this matter as \033WRhwak\033X \033WII\033X in reality is simply a dumping ground for the Split more than anything else.\n\nMala Ni - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="171">Boron music to save the Universe</t>
		<t id="172">It has long been said that of all the races in the known universe, Boron music is the most orchestrated and soul-stirring. It has the ability to assist some patients to make dramatic health gains in only a short period of time and it is used in modern health centres to cure the sick from such illnesses as Ruba Tumb, Gastroid, Haghebust and Hajumba San, all of them being ailments that can affect the nervous system of any individual.\n\nAfter researching historical archives, GalNet has discovered recently that the common arrangement of most music from the Boron was actually originally inspired by the Xenon. After aeons of time in resistance against the Xenon, the Boron contrived to orchestrate music based upon intercepted communications from the Xenon. By communication, we mean the recording of interspatial transmissions along with the differently coloured universal background radio noise received from being in close proximity to any Xenon vessel. Time was spent on Boron homeworlds listening to these noises and then layering this with composite drum beats, stringed, wooden and even semi-sentient instruments. The result, music that is proven to heal even the lame!\n\nResearch is now underway by the Argon and Teladi to see whether or not this unusual treatment can help many individuals on a grand scale in the future. The idea is to subject beings from each species to different frequencies of Boron music to try and see how each individual will react to the sound. This will take many, many jazuras of research as they need to test billions of individuals with differing genetic makeup to get an accurate reading. Time will then be needed to receive official medical recommendations from every race. With the instability of the Expansion Region at this moment in time, research is going to be slow. While the Teladi wish for the research to go well, as much profit awaits them, the Boron, being the most tranquil and peaceful race in the universe, are simply pleased with this opportunity for their music to help save the universe.\n\nArmin Penna - Music Correspondent, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="181">New understanding of Black Holes</t>
		<t id="182">In recent 'human' history, the most common theory as to the causal effects within a black hole, were as follows:\n\nAs an object, travelling at the speed of light, reached a certain point in the gravitational field of a black hole, it attained the possibility where it could either enter the hole or be ejected outwards; a point known as the 'event horizon.' If the object was to travel a little closer to the hole, it would then no longer be able to resist the gravitational pull and would be sucked in. Once it was pulled down into the black hole, it would collide with other matter travelling at the speed of light and would then most likely be pulled to pieces at that point. But if it were to survive that moment, it would reach a state known as a 'singularity'; an unknown object that weighs infinitely more than its mass would indicate. In this instance, the matter could be ejected from the hole and then repeatedly pulled back down by the gravitational pull in an endless cycle.\n\nScientists have now developed an expanded theory on this. After crossing the 'event horizon', as a traveller into the black hole, you could be met by everything you've ever seen in your entire life; from baby photos to the first space shuttle you ever bought. This is known as the 'flashback effect' and immediately after this stage you would find yourself knee deep in Petroleum Jelly \(an ancient Earth means of combustion\). In these final moments, you would be then set ablaze by your own body heat and vaporised with your soul being serenaded into the afterlife by a million singing Barium nuclides.\n\nThe reasons are unknown as to why this theory was ever registered with the Academy of Science on Argon Prime, but we thought it'd provide a good laugh for the GalNet audience.\n\nThank you for your moment in time.\n\nWein Galder - Chief Editor, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="211">The Terran Conflict</t>
		<t id="212">Initial impressions can be wrong. We at the \033WSolara\033X \033WNews\033X \033WNetwork\033X had offered a heartfelt welcome to the Terran diplomats and their security forces when they first arrived in our home sector. We tried to accept their presence here as we also tried to regard their massive new base as both inspiring and in some way beautiful. We hoped that our friends would strive to get along with us, as we tried to get along with them. However, time has shown that the Terrans have nothing else in mind but pure conquest and a desire to exploit our territories. Even their architecture reflects their will to dominate everything that they desire but isn't yet theirs. The Aldrians welcomed the Terran diplomats as messengers of peace, when in reality they should have treated them as conquerors and pirates.\n\nKaren Styles - Solara News Network</t>		
		<t id="220">politics:Aldrin</t>
		<t id="221">The beginning of conquest</t>
		<t id="222">To remind our readers once again, we take a brief look at how the Terrans betrayed the trust of the Aldrian people.\n\nAfter the first few wozuras had passed since the Terran representatives arrived in \033WSolara\033X, their Ambassador was seen repeatedly on the news and in person at many events, as if demonstrating his willingness to be open and to be accessible to the  people. However, tensions soon grew to exist between him and the Interstellar Relations Bureau Chief of Aldrin, and though we hoped at that time that this was all just a small misunderstanding, our experience in the political arena told us that this thinly veiled hostility might only be the very start of things to come.\n\nWith this in mind, we endeavoured to celebrate the addition of the new gate built by the Terrans to speed up travel to some of our outer sectors. "Surely such an expensive and large project as this shows their ability and resolve to stay and help us," we thought. And yet, despite the good intentions we expressed, the Terrans did not try and attempt to hide their desire to take over Aldrin - to take over our rightful home and to take away what was rightfully ours! In hindsight, we can only lament our naivety, and to learn from this experience to distrust the Terrans and other outsiders in the future.\n\nKaren Styles - Solara News Network</t>

The \033WTerran\033X \033WAmbassador\033X then asked for his security team to remove his accuser from the proceedings by any means necessary.

		<t id="312">The Chief of Aldrin Security, \033WMajor\033X \033WJohn\033X \033WThomas\033X, made the following statement this tazura to the media:\n\n"We know for a fact that many of these so called 'accidents' in Solara space are being caused by Terran forces and their mercenary friends. When all of our substantial evidence is ready to be released, I will reveal everything to all races, and show that their new friends, the Terrans, are nothing more than looters and conquerors."\n\nAfter this announcement, he immediately disappeared back into his office leaving the media representatives baffled as to whether there is any substance to this, and whether the widely publicised accusations against the Terran military actions in Solara space are true.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="322">As a consequence of \033WMajor\033X \033WThomas\033X from Aldrin Security making many bold and provocative statements just last tazura, Terran Ambassador \033WColonel\033X \033WSamuel\033X \033WJackson\033X, was asked at his regular news conference what he thought about the Major. "Since I obviously don't have access to his military files, it's hard for me to judge him on his record. However, since I have been here, I have dealt with many good and solid Aldrian military officers of lesser rank and found them all to be great assets to any military. For the Major to be such a high ranking officer, I can only assume he is the best Aldrin has to offer and as such well deserving of the position given to him."\n\nThe difference in character between the Aldrin Security Chief and the Terran Ambassador is obvious; it speaks volumes about his professionalism that the Ambassador doesn't hold a grudge for things said against him recently.\n\nColonel Jackson was asked before he left whether he would consider a purely political appointment in Solara space after his tour of duty ends. He politely smiled and said that he would serve as needed, where needed, and then left the podium. With such clearly admirable traits it seems certain the Colonel, in some form or other, will be in Aldrian politics for a long time to come."\n\nMarkus Walter - Terran Morning News</t>

		<t id="341">Expansion Region - downfall of the Kingdom?</t>
		<t id="342">The Expansion Region was planned to be settled with the greater good of the Kingdom in mind, but it may turn out however that it is exactly this type of colonial activity that will cause the complete collapse of the Boron Kingdom's government. Before the discovery of \033WAldrin\033X and the rapid subsequent colonisation, the Boron Kingdom had achieved an almost perfect economic efficiency rating, said to be even higher than that of the Teladi themselves. The exploration and colonisation of the Expansion Region, together with the hurried occupation of territory before any economic consolidation, has caused the Boron home economy to experience a continuous financial drain from the colonies. If the ever increasing losses continue, this may be enough to empty the royal treasury within two jazuras.\n\nDespite the old territory of the Commonwealth suffering greatly, the economic strain may not be immediately visible within the colonies themselves as most of the government funding is directed there towards building new enterprises, factories, stations and settlements. More than one third of all space trade has ceased between \033WKingdom's\033X \033WEnd\033X and \033WArgon\033X \033WPrime\033X, the average profit rating has fallen by \033Y13.768\033X% in the last two jazuras alone, and one fifth of all Boron space stations have been sold to various private investors and Teladi bankers. Many Boron workers are starting to show signs of discontent and weariness, and more and more unions are beginning to claim that the rush to colonise has been a tremendous mistake of the highest order.\n\nThe \033WQueen\033X \033WMenelaus\033X has said that she is aware of the situation, but this initial difficult period is unavoidable during the lasting and permanent establishment of the new Boron territories. In the long run she said, the additional resources provided by the newly claimed planets and asteroid fields would be beneficial for the industrial development of the Boron race everywhere. According to her, future generations will be grateful for this decision, and to back out now, when the most difficult phase was nearly over, would be a folly the likes the Kingdom had never seen. Financial experts however doubt that the lowest point has even been reached yet, and in any case, whether any future benefits could be expected at all.\n\nNi Lila - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

Station managers have asked for permission to allow people, who agree to share accommodation, to double up in some rooms for a short period while awaiting their permits to travel into the new sectors. This normally requires an approval from Aldrin authorities, as rules have long since been in existence stating that only married couples are allowed to cohabitate. Many see this as a ridiculous situation as many people other than married couples, of different and even the same sex, have cohabitated and no one has previously objected. But since this is now such a publicly widespread practice, permission has been sought for an official waiver to the regulations.\n\nUnisos Hegebalios Ignanias IV - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="402">Soon after the settling of \033WNecessary\033X \033WTribute\033X, a problem relating to an indigenous lifeform arose. A vicious aquatic predator species, the \033WGhwaark\033X, posed a great danger to Boron settlers. Unwilling to be the instigators in the complete annihilation of a whole species, the Boron royal family decided to undertake one of the greatest operations of wildlife preservation in known history; the complete relocation of an entire species to a neighbouring planet. At the time, this was widely recognised as the best possible solution and proof that the Boron had retained their inherent peaceful and ecological ideology, despite the countless wars they had been forced to participate in.\n\nHowever, with the Boron economy being already extremely weak, the adverse consequences from this operation have now begun to show themselves and there is now a very real threat to the emergency annual budget. The \033WRoyal\033X \033WDepartment\033X \033Wof\033X \033WEconomy\033X has decided that the additional \033Y3.76 billion\033X credits necessary for the continuation of this relocation project will be taken from this jazura's healthcare budget. This means that if there was to be a greater than average number of illnesses leading to unplanned medical operations among the Boron people, a situation might develop where the sick will be denied certain government funded medical services entirely. This is only a remote possibility however, and although it can be avoided with a little bit of luck and financial planning, in the worst case scenario, the saving of one animal species on a single planet in the Expansion Region may cost several hundred thousand Boron lives within the coming jazura.\n\nMoko Ni - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

		<t id="432">The trading station in sector \033WAtropos\033X \033WII\033X will be closed until further notice due to a pair of Teladi transport ships colliding, trying to beat each other to the dock. The ships collided close to a docking port and exploded, causing the destruction of the hub and some minor damage to the station itself. Although the pilots safely ejected just in time, the local authorities continue to detain them until they agree to pay for the damage and the station is reopened for business. Both of the pilots are suspected to have been under the influence of Spaceweed at the time of the accident, and this is being blamed for intensifying the usual Teladi passion for profits to the point of madness.\n\nOne Teladi captain protested when arrested: "It was all HER fault, I called for and got permission to dock, and after she scanned me to see if I was carrying the same cargo as her, she forced her way in, causing the accident! I believe that she alone should be responsible for the damage, as it was clearly not my fault." The second captain made similar accusations, and refused to pay for the damage as well.

		<t id="471">Queen Menelaus's affair</t>
		<t id="472">When the beloved and wise Queen \033WAtreus\033X of the Boron Kingdom joined her husband on the other side of the eternal ocean, the young and inexperienced princess \033WMenelaus\033X was left as the only heir to the throne. Though there was no possibility of changing the line of succession, a fair number of the highest royal courtiers expressed their concern over the lack of expertise and the youthful diversions that might plague the new and inexperienced queen. Up until now, there had been no reason to doubt the judgement and actions of our leaders, but the latest turn of events may show a side of \033WMenelaus\033X that the people were not supposed to see.\n\nIt is well known that \033WMenelaus\033X has unfailingly supported the decision to colonise areas of the Expansion Region and claim as large a swathe of territory as possible. Publicly, the expansion was supported by the fact that these sectors contained vast amounts of minerals and natural resources, crucial for the stability of our economy in the long term. However, for the last three mazuras, the costs of new colonisations have caused a heavy toll on the Boron economy and people and this bad situation is expected to remain for at least the next five jazuras. Latest analysis of the territories acquired in the current expansionist rush shows that the costs might be far greater than what was originally foreseen, and that there is a significant chance that the Boron economy will never recover to its former strength.\n\nAll this aside however, what has been the root cause of the recent large riots is a leaked tridimensional video showing some security footage of a meeting between the highest ranking Boron officials and the queen herself - half a jazura before the \033WEdict\033X \033Wof\033X \033WExpansion\033X was issued. In the video, it is shown that the queen and her subordinates had discussed and analysed the possible implications of the expansion and its influence on the economical, political and military strength of the Kingdom. Queen \033WMenelaus\033X had been informed that the probable damage to the economy would be irreparable, and that the only benefit would be an indirect boost to the Military forces, under the guise of a request for more ships for the expansion fleet.\n\nCountless Boron labour agencies have now begun to protest in light of this new evidence, claiming that the queen had acted out of childish spite and competitiveness, without proper any regard for her subjects.

Through great effort, both sides have finally come to an agreement, and there are now no trade tariffs for Split merchants if they buy and sell in Terran space.

When the Boron economy first showed signs of weakness, the best Split minds focused upon a new strategy - economic warfare.

The Split stations buy from the Boron at low prices, and then sell with increased taxes, all this reducing any Split money from flowing into the Boron treasury. Similar market manipulation with the other races and the new trade treaties with the Teladi and Terrans help to ensure that the Boron economy keeps having a hard time.

The group, who successfully claimed the moon for mining, said that they intended to mine into the surface and make a home together there for all, a sort of "communal" society which would work well in isolation from others. The moon had sufficient minerals to last for generations, and other new colonies in the area seemed to guarantee them business for jazuras to come. However, the Split military has refused them the right to settle there until the sector becomes more stable, sighting as evidence the recent destruction of convoys and heavy transporters and the increase in hostile activity throughout the Expansion Region.\n\n"They seem to think that a mining community that far out in space will just be 'overlooked' by the pirates, but we disagree. Their claim is valid, but at the present time things are too dangerous for us to allow colonisation there. Besides, we will not tolerate them making secret spacefly hatcheries without our consent," so said the Split military commander of the area as the colonists filed an official protest with the Patriarch.\n\nIncidentally, the colonists in question have been known to participate in banned spacefly hunts back in the Commonwealth, the very reason for which they had recently moved into the Expansion Region.

		<t id="592">The Split people are known to be warlike and ferocious in every aspect of their lives and until now, even their own traders were not given much respect. All true Split see them as dropouts, ones who had lost their true path in life by selling it cheaply for temporary peace and serenity. Until now that is! At a recent conference attended by traders of all races, the main issue debated was the danger that Split traders pose to others. Thousands of reports from all over space tell how Split traders have used their turrets, rammed their ships into others and blocked trading routes to ensure they closed a deal first.\n\nWimpy Borons and Argons have said that this behaviour "broke all ethical norms and the practice should be abolished for the greater good of interstellar trade relations". At least the Teladi approve of our traders, saying that profit is indeed above all else, although they note that "Split traders are so overzealous in their madness that often they damage their own ships too much and suffer profit loss". The most number of complaints, 68 in all, have been filed against \033WZrt\033X \033Wt'Gmmr\033X, a pilot of the Split \033WCaiman\033X \033WMiner\033X \033W"Bloodhound"\033X and so he is to be awarded with a new honour, "Most Ferocious Trader of the Jazura".

		<t id="602">The Paranid military has confirmed a report which stated that a smuggler ship self-destructed to avoid being caught by the authorities in a nearby sector. As it is hard to believe that a pirate would choose death instead of capture, particularly in this case only over a load of cheap contraband, increased attention was directed to the investigation of this incident. The area was fully swept for survivors and none were found leaving the possibility that, now that the military is on to them, the smugglers are using an advanced pilotless auto-navigation system to avoid being captured.\n\nThe Paranid Ambassador commented \(off the record\) that this looked like a new application for the much despised Aldrian AGI technology, but the \033WSolara\033X \033WSecurity\033X \033WCouncil\033X unequivocally denied this, stating that no information leaks or theft had occurred and that the technology was under heavy guard, completely safe from both petty criminals and smugglers.

The ship's captain refused to comment as the security officers lead him away and his cargo, consisting mainly of Argon whiskey and Spaceweed, was confiscated. While this seems like a trivial incident, independent sources say that smuggling of similar illegal merchandise within Argon space is commonplace, and often routinely ignored. Solara Security officers have however declared that "as such, obviously criminal dealings will not be tolerated HERE; we have a higher expectation from our people! If the Argon government cannot control their borders, then we will surely make these people pay the price for coming here and spreading their depravity in Solara space!"

This ranges from being thrown off of Aldrian stations for no reason, to unprovoked attacks in the trade lanes.

The ambassador acknowledged that mercenaries can sometimes be a bit overzealous, but they are essential in patrolling the outer sectors and searching for survivors after pirate attacks.\n\nThe ambassador mentioned that they, the Teladi, themselves hire mercenaries and have seen them perform exceptional work, and so she couldn't see what the Security Service was thinking of by demanding the ban. She would therefore not bow to Aldrian restrictions on this, no matter how much they demanded it, as it was clearly a folly that would lead to a loss of profits.\n\nWhile the Aldrians have been relaxed lately about the pirate activity in their system, this seems like yet another new confrontation with alien governments. This particular situation is odd beyond doubt, as mercenaries do good work and save lives... mostly, and if the Solara Government can't see this then it is rather clear that profit is not a concept they are aware of.\n\nYossilleas Nesilinis Tomassenas III - Central Economy News</t>

		<t id="672">A mercenary on his way home from a mission in an outer sector, has made a grisly discovery just last tazura. Drifting slowly towards a gate was a spacesuit, and after retrieving it, he found a dead body frozen inside. The deceased pilot had obviously ejected from a disabled or destroyed ship some distance away and with no stations nearby, he was trying to reach the gate before his oxygen supply ran out. This tragic tale is all too common these tazuras, as pirates, hostile corporations and other groups are constantly fighting over territory and resources in the Expansion Region. Often damaged and crippled ships are left to fend for themselves with tragic results due to a shortage of military patrols in the newly claimed territories.\n\nThe Argon military is performing DNA analysis on the body for positive identification so his family can know of his fate. No further investigation will be launched however as there was no sign of any ship debris in the vicinity. This suggests that if there had indeed been a fight, the ship had been boarded by the attackers and then flown off.\n\nWilliamsphere Shaker - Interstellar Broadcast Company</t>

The assault lasted several mizuras as the attacking hostiles refused to stop when hailed by the mercenary leader. The small fleet of unidentified raiders only broke off when it was obvious that they were outmatched and outgunned, they then disappeared through the nearest gate.\n\nThis has become an all too regular occurrence since corporations and mercenary groups have started fighting and retaliating against each other all over the Expansion Region. This makes life hard for free traders and severely reduces the flow of credits, and brings more tension to an already strained situation as one group after another tries to pass the blame for previous hostile acts onto someone else.

Discussions are still continuing this tazura as these two groups try to settle this, but the obvious contempt for alien races expressed by the Aldrians will be an obstacle.

All the ships had been destroyed apart from one which had been left simply damaged and disabled. Onboard the floating ship he couldn't locate any survivors, but in the cargo compartment he did find a large amount of Silicon wafers, which he immediately loaded onto his own vessel. "The crew were all dead, so there's no reason to just let it float there," he was quoted as he celebrated a large bank balance and a totally empty cargo hold having sold all the wafers at a station nearby.\n\nThe trader was questioned as to the location of the ship remnants, but he refused to give a specific co-ordinates. The police became suspicious and tracked the trader as he returned to the site for more scavenging and found that the trader had lied to the authorities. The crew of the surviving ship was not dead at all, but merely locked inside the escape pods and prevented from escaping.

		<t id="762">The workers on the trading station in \033WNaos\033X \033WNihal\033X had the shock of their lives when a normal routine freighter check unexpectedly turned into a hostage crisis. An old and beaten up Teladi-owned trading ship was transporting minerals to various stations in the Boron territory and as local police officer \033WSalano\033X \033WWi\033X scanned the ship as part of his routine customs check, he immediately encountered a field distorter that made any inspection impossible. He contacted the captain of the transport ship, and the pilot told the police officer that it was probably a result of a malfunction in an engine manifold. The trader was ordered to dock at the local trading station for repairs and for another customs check and as there was no sign of danger at that time, the only persons waiting for it were two technicians. To their surprise however, a number of pirates jumped from the ship the very moment it docked, and took them both hostage. The military and local police were alerted immediately, and within ten sezuras, the entire station was surrounded by the \033W4th\033X \033WRoyal\033X \033WBoron\033X \033WPeacekeeper\033X \033WFleet\033X. The pirates then relayed their demands, asking for the release of the notorious pirate \033WNarsilagi\033X \033WWi\033X, held in captivity by the Boron for two mazuras. It began to seem likely that their demand would have to be fulfilled, but pure luck saved the situation.\n\nA young and inexperienced pilot of an Argon \033WMercury\033X was rushing to dock at the station to meet his girlfriend, and didn't bother to notice the numerous military ships in the vicinity or even carry out the usual basic docking safety procedures. His ship knocked against the pirate trader and sent a fierce jolt throughout the vessel and knocked over everyone inside. The two technician hostages being accustomed to zero-g situations and unstable working conditions quickly recovered and escaped hastily out of the ship. The moment they reached safety back on the station, two military Rays began to carefully fire at the docked ship aiming at such an angle so as not to damage the station. Their objective had been to disable the ship and make it immobile, but it seems that the pirates had installed explosive devices in their vessel, which promptly detonated within the first ten sezuras of incoming fire. A large explosion destroyed the ship and ruined the docking clamps, but thankfully no Boron lives were lost.\n\nSince this incident, the police in \033WNaos\033X \033WNihal\033X have tripled their forces, and now scan as many passing ships as possible, in fear of another renewed attack. Some analysts claim that the likelihood of another attack will increase as the followers of \033WNarsilagi\033X \033WWi\033X draw closer and closer.\n\nNali To - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

Shamefully, a lot of them have had no experience in fighting an enemy, and they are not fit to be called proper Split warriors yet. To solve this, the Split military has launched a new programme, focused on teaching recruits the intricacies of real space combat. These courses are funded by the \033WFamily\033X \033WRhonkar\033X and all interested Split can apply to take part, even those not in the military yet. The training programme will consist of three parts with the first seeing the participants given a basic light interceptor ship and then taught asteroid-skipping, station-hugging and hit'n'run warfare. Next, they will sit through navigational theory, learn to utilise the standard military issue jump drive in combat, and be able to use basic strategies such as ambushes.\n\nThen finally, real combat practice begins. The ships will be equipped with special training weapons that can drain shields but cannot damage hulls, but if they do strike the ship itself, they send a medium strength electric shock to the pilot, causing him to black out for several mizuras. This is done to protect the valuable military hardware whilst giving the trainees an unforgettable taste of actual warfare. Various military admirals have said that this new training regime will ensure proper instruction for new recruits, and also serve as a good advertisement for joining the military. So far it appears to be working; twice as many new recruits have applied for combat pilot duty, with some of them being well past their prime.\n\nGrk t'Snnf - Split Clan News</t>

The local Teladi shipbuilding representative claimed that he had no information on any Teladi shipyards selling their ships to either unregistered buyers or suspected pirate quartermasters.

		<t id="822">Despite the captain of a heavy transporter recently relating that a number of pirate ships had saved his ship from annihilation by unmarked hostile vessels, \033WSolara\033X \033WSecurity\033X is now inferring that it was probably only luck that actually saved him. They think for some reason the destruction of the unknown ships by the pirate raiders was simply more important to them than the looting of yet another transport ship from Split space. \033WSolara\033X \033WSecurity\033X reports that there's no evidence that the pirates are any less deadly now than before, and they suspect that the unmarked ships may have attacked the pirate clans elsewhere, bringing about a sort of revenge attack in retaliation.\n\nThe \033WSolara\033X \033WSecurity\033X spokesman also denied any rumours about a pirate shipyard hidden within the \033WSolara\033X system itself, claiming that their long-range scanners would have picked up any unauthorised construction and the moment it had become operational. Nevertheless, the fact that the pirates operating in Aldrian territory appear to have access to advanced and brand new fighter craft is a sufficient threat to warrant yet more vigilance and strengthening of military patrols.\n\nLee Stock - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="832">Heavy Transporter Captain \033WSam\033X \033WPickens\033X, was seen celebrating until late this tazura near the local repair station in \033WSirius\033X \033WPrime\033X. His ship, the '\033WHometown\033X', had just finished a difficult voyage through seven sectors delivering stations for the Split and Teladi. This trip marked the final payoff on the loan for his ship and as such, a real good reason to celebrate.\n\nCaptain \033WPickens\033X is celebrating not just his good fortune, but his 50th birthtazura as well, which he missed while occupied with navigation through a particularly dense asteroid field encountered on the last trip. When asked for the secret of his success, he simply said, "Get in and get out quickly, and never look back." Good advice for any pilot, much less for one flying a heavy transport ship. Captain \033WPickens\033X own personal track record is unmatched by any other freelance heavy transporter pilot in the entire Expansion Region, this is mainly due to the fact that he never asks any questions about the nature of the cargo that needs transporting. He himself has publicly admitted that he had taken on contracts from pirates for transporting the construction kits for space fuel distilleries, space weed complexes and once, even for a pleasure facility. As Captain \033WPickens\033X himself said, "Transporting unbuilt factories is not illegal. I don't care what the customer does with the parts afterwards... I only care that I get paid and then there are no further complications between myself and my client. Check the laws, if you doubt me.

		<t id="842">Solara Security switched to their highest state of alert this tazura, as a Paranid fighter wing left their own home sector and started patrolling the outer regions of the \033WSolara\033X system. The \033WParanid\033X \033WAmbassador\033X was quick to point out that one sector in particular had been a problem lately for Paranid shipping and as the Solara military was clearly inferior and appeared unworthy in the task of protecting superior beings, they wanted to be sure that the area was clear of enemy forces.\n\nSolara Security Chief, \033WMajor\033X \033WFrank\033X \033WJones\033X, has demanded their immediate recall, warning that if they were observed in any sector outside of legally recognised Paranid space, he would order them to be fired upon. The Ambassador reluctantly acquiesced and ordered the ships to return but he insisted that more Aldrian forces are ordered to patrol the outer systems.\n\nThe tension in Solara space is at breaking point already, and this small incident could have erupted into a major confrontation, if the Paranids hadn't backed down.\n\nSara Himes - Solara News Network</t>

Although he avoided a military confrontation by recalling a Paranid scout patrol when the Solara Security Council demanded it, the upper echelons of the Paranid military are less than pleased with the way things have been going.\n\nWhile previously the ambassador has had nothing but good publicity, this last diplomatic dispute gave rise to rumours of him being recalled from active duty on the grounds of failing to maintain Paranid superiority, failure to get Paranid demands accepted by the Aldrians, and even being an Aldrian collaborator. Immediately after these criticisms surfaced, \033WPriest\033X \033WDuke\033X \033WKetckamanckatrassalt\033X came forward in his defence, saying that "no one in his position can please everyone, but as one of his superiors I will say he has shown great honour and faith in everything he has done, and this last incident was no exception.

		<t id="862">With several races having now established their own core sectors in Solara space, the Solara Security Council has requested assistance in patrolling these new sectors this tazura.\n\n"If these new races do indeed plan on remaining there, they will need to implement some proper security within their own sectors. Solara Security will gladly entrust the patrol duties of these sectors to other races. Furthermore, we will tolerate certain ships there that we wouldn't normally permit to transit Solara space, as long as they stay in their assigned destination sectors."\n\nIt was reported that to make this possible, an agreement with the Argon and Boron was only just finalised in the last few tazuras and these two races quickly signed the new accord. However, the above statement from the Security Chief is certain to cause doubt regarding the Aldrian position on any future colonial expansion, as it appears that the Aldrians do not fully recognise the newly claimed sectors as being the legally owned territory of those races. Instead, our political analysts say that the Aldrians consider that the entire Expansion Region, not just the Solara subsectors, is still under their rule. Despite this, the Aldrians seem to be slowly releasing their legal hold over these areas of space, and with each new treaty, more and more power is being transferred to the Commonwealth races. Political experts say that this is probably just a charade for the Aldrian public, as the government of \033WAldrin\033X clearly recognises that the Commonwealth races are in no way subordinate or subject to their law.\n\nRicky Jermaine - Interstellar Broadcast Company</t>

After a difficult negotiating session between Solara Security and the Terran Ambassador lasting a whole tazura, with the Borons sitting in as arbitrators, an agreement was finally reached. This new accord allows two Terran patrols to be assigned to the new Terran sectors for their protection only, with a reciprocal agreement that Solara Security forces would no longer be responsible for the safety of any Terran ship or station in the future.\n\n"It is a great tazura when these two nations can come together in such a calm and patient manner to forge an agreement," the Boron negotiator said after the meeting, but as the Terran Ambassador smiled and posed for reporters, the Solara Security Chief strode away without saying a word.\n\nJames Norman - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="882">With the recent new agreements allowing other races to patrol their own sectors, more Aldrian ships are starting to be seen closer to \033WAldrin\033X and sectors nearby. This has been great for security of the local trade lanes, but not all freighter captains are happy with the new arrangement.\n\n"It was difficult enough before with all the pirate raids during our trading runs, but now we have Solara Security stopping us at every opportunity to search ships that were only just inspected less than a stazura ago! This is pure harassment, plain and simple, and we have complained to officials at the \033WTraders\033X \033WGuild\033X on Aldrin about these practices." The representatives of the Traders Guild stated that Solara Security should once again justify their rules of engagement covering both friendly and unfriendly ships passing through the core sectors around \033WAldrin\033X.\n\n"If Solara Security isn't careful, they will make themselves look like an oppressive dictatorship in the eyes of all the races we deal with. What might be needed is an official review of their authority and behaviour, maybe even the removal of their right to scan ships that are simply passing through their territory that have no intention of docking there." It was even said that a major investigation is the last thing Solara Security want, as their Chief has bent if not broken many agreements on free trade in the past in order to slow the Terran advance into their sectors.\n\nYoogolisseas Nobulis Saselaneas IV - Central Economy News</t>

It has been pointed out that the Aldrians still consider all territories in the Expansion Region to be subject to their laws, even outside of the Solara system. Controversially, they have not any issues over patrolling rights with the other races, but it does seem whenever the \033WUSC\033X is involved, the Solara government does its best to disrupt even routine low-level activity.\n\nThis does show however, that our Ambassador is not giving in as easily as some had recently inferred, and he has worked hard to get equal rights for the Terrans in the new sectors. By taking control of patrols in the newly colonised sectors, we will finally have some autonomy from Aldrian rule for the first time, and our people can heave a collective sigh of relief as Terran ships start protecting them.\n\nWhitney Desanta - Terran Morning News</t>

		<t id="901">Is BoFu lethal for the elderly?</t>
		<t id="902">As is commonly known, BoFu is made mostly from plankton and is used extensively on Boron space stations everywhere as a basic food ingredient. A recent study however has shown that it has the capability to accelerate aging in a non-linear fashion depending on the current age and the amount of BoFu nuggets eaten over a Boron's lifetime.\n\nIronically, some young scientists only made this accidental discovery whilst conducting seemingly useless experiments for practice, in the vague hope of making a breakthrough. It turns out that BoFu nuggets have the capability of overloading a Boron's digestive system if the individual is in a continuously weakened state. In such cases, the nuggets can release relatively large amounts of BoGas as a result of a chemical reaction which is similar to the one used to produce BoGas - the universe's best anaesthetic. Once a significant quantity of BoGas has been trapped within the individual's stomach, it soon enters the bloodstream of the victim, rendering nerves unresponsive and disrupting all reflexive muscular movements. In extreme cases, and when the sufferer has aged significantly and is not strong enough to combat this harmful effect or counter it directly, the result may be lethal and cause terminal failure in several vital organs. Since at the age of 60, most space-goers retire or take on sedate and less stressful jobs in research facilities and other planet-based enterprises, these adverse effects have never been noticed before.\n\nThe novice scientists who are behind this study say that the results will need to be verified, but if they are proven to be correct, it might warrant a complete re-examination of the average lifestyle of every Boron who is past their prime. It is thought that a new drug might have to be introduced to combat this effect, and that the average number of pills that a Boron would need to take regularly during each tazura is 17 or 18. Naturalists have already been debating with the \033WRoyal\033X \033WHealthcare\033X \033WInstitute\033X on ways to reduce this unnecessary burden and if there might be ways to administer any necessary substances indirectly.\n\nNena Pi - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

		<t id="911">Discovery of new ship drive theory</t>
		<t id="912">Though current engine technologies have allowed space vessels to become almost energy self-sufficient, there is still a small but significant amount of theoretical research being conducted with the intention of creating new propulsion systems that would prove to be less harmful to life. Scientists at the \033WRoyal\033X \033WInstitute\033X \033Wof\033X \033WApplied\033X \033WPhysics\033X have stumbled upon a discovery that if pursued and refined, might fundamentally alter existing propulsion theory and drive design entirely.\n\nFor many centuries, most spacecraft engines have relied upon using an energy source to create a reaction within a sealed chamber and then use this to literally push the ship through space. In a radical departure from this, scientists have now turned their minds to the one thing that is in infinite supply in this galaxy - gravity itself. Though the precise nature of the galaxy's gravitational field has not yet been determined, a way of neutralising it within a small area has recently been discovered. The exact details of the technology itself are being kept secret, but it has been revealed that currently only individual molecules can be isolated from gravitational influence, and this was possible without altering the molecules themselves. This means that if perfected and applied correctly, the same method could be used on complex structures, such as live tissue.\n\nThe process is said to be relatively energy-efficient and so if this breakthrough could be applied to whole ships, it would be viable for commercial use. Discarding standard engines, ships would have to be re-designed to use a device that was capable of altering the field intensity of the local gravity well surrounding it, to effectively pull it through space. At the moment, the concept itself is not yet perfectly understood and it is far too early to speculate further and make wild assumptions as much more extensive testing and development is still required.\n\nWhen the scientists were asked whether the mass production of such a 'gravitic' drive would be possible anytime soon, they responded that at the current rate of research, more than 200 jazuras would be needed to develop the necessary mathematical laws, concepts and equations. Worse still, even more time would then be required to physically test the engineered prototype for any discrepancies and possible hidden faults.\n\nLolo Pi - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

		<t id="922">The new colonies of the Boron Kingdom offer a great opportunity for research projects in both physical and social sciences and thankfully the Royal Boron Government is committed to supporting scientific activities in the name of common benefit to the Boron Kingdom. However, there is currently an unexpected problem, and one that was not predicted at all. With the demands for new research having increased almost two-fold, there is a lack of scientific personnel that are able and willing to work in the new territories. To address this, additional universities have been recently opened in the Expansion Region, but they will not produce fresh scientific graduates for at least five jazuras. There is now a complete lack of professionals holding academic degrees, and so consequently average wages in the research industry have skyrocketed in the new territories.\n\nThe Boron have always been at the forefront of science, but with this current problem, the Kingdom of Boron may well lose its place as one of the leading scientific races in the known universe.

		<t id="932">It is no secret that there is a massive competition among the races for the freelance fighter market. Unlike capital ships which never reach commodity status and are strictly sold only to private corporations and very rich individuals, the trade of smaller ships such as fighters and luxury passenger transports is getting fiercer by the stazura. There are hundreds of factors that may persuade people to buy one race's ship over another, and the foremost among them is the annual ship evaluation competition. This event is where every  mainstream production ship is pitted against all others to compete in one of four categories - Best Fighter, Best Trader, Best Cruiser and Best Design.\n\nIt is common for the winning entries to see a rise in sales throughout the following mazuras, therefore the prize and title is something all shipbuilders hope to win. The three lesser categories were won by the Split \033WAsp\033X, Paranid \033WDemeter\033X and Boron \033WHammerhead\033X, but the main category, the Best Design award, was finally taken away from the Argon \033WNova\033X, ending its five-jazura long winning streak, and awarded to the re-launched edition of the Boron \033WSkate\033X which features improved weapon support, generators, cargo capacity and acceleration. The current iteration of the \033WSkate\033X is claimed to be the pinnacle of Boron design, combining deadly effectiveness and aesthetic, luxurious design in one vessel.\n\nUnlike the heavy fighters of the other races, the Skate is a proficient all-rounder, capable of doing pretty much everything that needs to be done equally well. It possesses no known weaknesses in most situations, and as a Teladi military tactician has stated, the \033WSkate\033X is easily the most versatile fighter available.

Scientists have proposed a special monitoring system that would create a link with all ship computers within the vicinity of a gate, and give automated clearance for gate entry only when the other side was completely clear of obstacles. Unfortunately, such technology would not only need great financial investment in the development and support of the monitoring system, but also a mandatory upgrade for ship computers to accommodate safeguard protocols protecting against errors, which would be far too costly for any government to fund.\n\nRamba Nigredo - Interstellar Broadcast Company</t>

		<t id="1001">Focus on Ion weaponry is a mistake, says scientist</t>
		<t id="1002">Over the last jazuras, Boron weapon designers have made one breakthrough after another in the field of Ion weaponry. Initially planned as a supposedly defensive weapon, the \033WIon\033X \033WDisruptor\033X, it has now evolved into over five working Ion-based mass-production weapons, three prototypes in testing and two further top-secret projects. Something however appears to have been lost in the spirit of development as the newest of Ion weapons are not nearly so self-defensive in nature to their targets anymore. Most of the new Ion weapons are now able to cause direct hull damage as well as disruption to shields and ship electronics. Moreover, by interfering with the neural fields that are associated with an individual's mind, they have been proven to cause harm to the crew of any ship under Ion weapon fire.\n\nThis is not the greatest problem with the Ion weapons, however. Professor Loco Po of the \033WRoyal\033X \033WResearch\033X \033WInstitute\033X on \033WKingdom's\033X \033WEnd\033X declared "This single-minded focus on Ion technology has cost us dearly. Most of our scientific facilities have been reassigned to work on Ion research and all our new science graduates have been taught only Ion-based weaponry theory. Now that the technology has reached the limit of its performance/price ratio, we must branch out and develop new technologies. Alas, this will be harder than anticipated; we are so obsessed with Ion weapons that we have forgotten everything else. Just lately, a group of our best scientists tried to design some light weaponry using a new principle and only managed to reproduce what was basically a weak and unrefined version of an Impulse Ray Emitter; a great shame and a wake-up call. The worst part though is that Ion weaponry is now considered inferior compared to that of the other races. While they are busy developing new armaments, we are in danger of falling behind, yet again. Moreover, all our ships are now designed around working with Ion weapons, and they will need massive refits to accommodate other weapon types in the future. We are already at the point of draining our ship's generators entirely when forcing them to work with older design weapons, like Particle Accelerator Cannons and Photon Pulse Emitters, and these are all relatively antique in themselves!"\n\nA large number of the scientific elite share these concerns, and it is entirely possible that the Boron ships will again be renowned for their peaceful intentions... but may be only because of a complete lack of advanced weaponry onboard.\n\nMoko Ni - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

He offered a hefty sum for her safe return but the pirate commander refused, saying she was worth more as a "hostage" to guarantee the safety of his station. An attack finally came after spies on board made contact with his daughter and sent back a harrowing video file of her begging for mercy, with signs of torture and mistreatment clearly visible. The industrialist snapped and ordered every security ship he owned to fly to the base and destroy it, killing not only the base's commander, but his own daughter as well.\n\n\033WSolara\033X \033WSecurity\033X immediately arrested \033WTemkins\033X for murder connected to the deaths of several other people known to be held on the station as hostages, and other families have pressed charges against him as well for his reckless actions.

The local patrols immediately plotted an intercept course, but the pirate fleet was too dispersed to be handled by the small fighters. While the heavy ships of the Terran fleet were still more than fifty clicks away, the Pirates launched an offensive against the living quarters of the power plant. Although the station took heavy damage, it survived and the pirates eventually withdrew after incurring severe losses once the military had finally entered weapons range. The pirate warlord was a master strategist and although the pirate cruisers had far less firepower, the pirate fleet managed to destroy three of the Terran destroyers and at least two frigates in a swift battle before leaving the sector via their jump drives. Despite the USC losing a total of twenty ships, they managed to almost completely destroy the pirate fleet, but the three main pirate attack vessels \(a destroyer, a carrier and a frigate\) escaped with their shields almost completely intact.\n\nPreviously thought secure against any attack, this is the first time that pirates have attacked a station in the Solar system. It is a mystery where the pirate forces acquired the functioning jump beacon or the software that allowed regular jump drives to lock onto it within the Solar system. The station manager has since revealed that he had been contacted two wozuras ago and asked to pay twenty million credits to a secure Teladi bank account; otherwise his station would be attacked. Naturally, as Terran space is considered to be the safest part of the Commonwealth, the manager simply terminated the communication link, thinking that it was a crank call. The United Space Command representative has said that in many other sectors, although some stations are refusing to pay, the majority secretly comply just to keep the pirates away from their ships and stations, but this should not be the case in Terran space.\n\nIn response to this shocking incident, the USC public relations department has issued a statement stating that from now on, special rapid response units would be setup to patrol all sectors. In order to prevent a similar attack from happening ever again, the patrols would be on the look-out for any anomalous objects that could serve as a jump focusing device. The station owner was quoted as saying that he'll rebuild and repair even if it means a small loss in the immediate future.\n\nTim Salvadore - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="1051">Attack on Loomanckstrat's Legacy finally over</t>
		<t id="1052">After two long jazuras of continued attack on the infamous pirate den in \033WLoomanckstrat's\033X \033WLegacy\033X, Boron Fleet Marshal \033WLoko\033X \033WNu\033X has reported that the pirate threat has finally been removed from the area and so travel from the Teladi to Paranid territories is once again safe for traders. The battle which was initially conceived as a series of light raids unexpectedly escalated when the pirates began to build hidden outposts in asteroids, rather than constantly reinforcing their Anarchy  port and uniting their clans there against the onslaught of the Commonwealth fleets. The most notable event in this war was the devastation of the Argon flagship \033WArgon\033X \033WOne\033X when a routine patrol ended with them being trapped within an asteroid field and then attacked by a joint pirate fleet of more than thirty capital ships. \033WArgon\033X \033WOne\033X just barely survived long enough to charge up its jump drive to escape the sector, suffering so much damage that it literally jumped into \033WArgon\033X \033WPrime\033X broken in half. No other Argon ships survived the attack, but it did serve as a wake-up call that prompted greater co-operation between the main Commonwealth races against the pirate threat.\n\nThe final pirate outpost has recently been found and destroyed, thus ending this prolonged conflict and establishing stability within the sector. For the last two mazuras, active pirate forces appear to have dwindled with only small frigates supported by a few badly equipped fighters struggling to attack the flanks of the combined Commonwealth fleets. Over the last few wozuras, a new strategy has been employed, with the Boron flagship utilising the new Ion torpedoes to empty the sector of hiding places. Asteroid by asteroid, any pirate outposts still remaining undiscovered in hollowed-out asteroids are obliterated out of existence. The final outpost was destroyed just last wozura, and with that, the pirate's claim over the territory has finally ended. Three surviving pirate fighter wings jumped out of the sector immediately after the last stronghold went up in a particularly large explosion. The shockwave of this blast incapacitated three Split carriers, but no casualties were taken by the Commonwealth forces.\n\nThe infamous "Pirate Alley" is now being patrolled by both Teladi and Paranid fleets, and a new and lucrative trade route has been established through the newly liberated territories. The Pirates have suffered too much loss over these past two jazuras to be able to launch an offensive any time soon, so for now, the area is truly safe for the first time in a hundred jazuras.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="1062">A disabled pirate craft was hauled into a shipyard from the outer sectors this tazura. While this in itself doesn't seem like big news, the design of this particular ship is extraordinary. It seems that during a mission, a mercenary came upon a pirate patrol led by this new craft and captured it after having destroyed its wingmen. This is the first time a pirate heavy fighter of this specification has been brought back intact and officials say it's not the standard \033WPirate\033X \033WBlastclaw\033X class heavy fighter which is usually used for such patrols. The captured ship is however something newer and bigger, with far better engines and generators, and much better adapted to incursions into enemy territory.\n\nBecause the ship has been equipped with advanced stealth features allowing it to effectively fly unseen at the fringes of a scanner range, the ship is currently being inspected by \033WSolara\033X \033WSecurity\033X together with their best scientists, ship designers and other research groups in Solara space. The mercenary who brought this ship in is overjoyed as he was not only paid a hefty reward for his precious find, but even the Terran Admiral sent his congratulations and offered him further opportunities to work for the Fuji Station in the future.\n\nSara Himes - Solara News Network</t>

This is a first for any race, and every Aldrian research team in \033WAldrin\033X is examining the craft. The features drawing most of the attention are the lack of any cockpit or life-support technology, and the fact the propulsion system and design is new to all of the scientific community. Solara Security is keeping a close eye on the ship and monitoring everyone coming and going, even the research teams are being scanned daily to ensure no potential infection is carried outside of the isolated research facility.\n\nAlthough the spread of knowledge of this new technology is being kept to a minimum, other military research facilities are now sending their best minds to study and test the alien ship. "This could be a revolution in the way we construct ship engines," said one research team leader, "it's possible a whole new generation of spacecraft will come from just this one ship." While the Argons have reported they have seen this technology before and dismissed it as unviable for commercial use, they have still not been able to successfully reproduce it and so Aldrian scientists are positively besides themselves at the prospect of getting ahead of their Argon and even Terran neighbours.\n\nWilson Brown - Solara News Network</t>

This new technology, possibly the finest alien artefact ever found, has gone missing tonight and Solara Security has hastily locked down the sector until their investigation finds evidence of what happened to it.\n\nWith security now being so incredibly tight, it's unimaginable that the thieves can get away with it, but so far no official statement about the stolen object has been released. Some people speculate this whole event was just staged by \033WSolara\033X \033WSecurity\033X as a publicity stunt in a bid to appear equal to the military strength of the other races, thought to be several orders of magnitude greater than what the Aldrians have at their disposal.

The attack, by several pirate corvettes and heavy fighters, was a complete surprise and even the fighter patrol guarding the convoy was taken aback by their viciousness and accuracy. Calling immediately for reinforcements, a Boron frigate jumped in as support and after a wild couple of stazuras, the attackers were finally defeated. The research station escaped undamaged but the military convoy was decimated with only a single surviving ship managing to limp into the station dock badly damaged.\n\n"We have lost priceless information and materials in this attack, and we're very disturbed knowing such a sizable enemy force was in this sector. It's possible this is a new offensive by the pirate clans pushing into our outer territories from other systems." This comment came from Captain \033WLi\033X \033WPau\033X \033WTon\033X, Second in Command of the Sector Security force in that area.

Most alien races hold the opinion that this is the Solara military's fault, as they appear unable to maintain security and prevent pirates from operating in the new territories. The Aldrians' view however is that the fault lies with the Terran High Command, as they are the ones who controlled the \033WPandora's\033X \033WGate\033X, connecting the Commonwealth and the Expansion Region in the first place. Nevertheless, the Boron have outlined the main pirate problem originates from the remote and unpatrolled regions of the \033WSolara\033X system. This territory has been labelled by the Aldrians as off-limits to all military ships but their own, and they refuse to increase their own patrol frequency or accept outside help with their patrols.\n\n"If this is what Aldrian forces call security, then we will have to repeat our demand, asking that Boron forces be allowed to patrol Solara sectors where our people are most vulnerable. Solara Security has proved beyond a doubt that they are incapable of protecting their own, and much less our people from enemy forces and other threats," said the Boron General Lilo Ton.\n\nTok Ni - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="1132">A more common occurrence of late, huge swarms of Spaceflies have been seen in Solara sectors this wozura. In one sector, the swarm was so large it stripped the shields from a freighter as it flew past, giving the crew some concern for a mizura or two.\n\nWhile the Aldrians have evidently long known about these ' space ghost lights', as they call them, they saw them as nothing more than a passing attraction for ship's passengers, a natural phenomenon that had nothing of value behind it. However, ever since the Split representative demonstrated the virtue of using them as a power source, much to the delight of the Aldrian scientists, further research and scientific meetings have been organised. Now plans are being made for the first station fully powered by the 'lights' and Aldrian industrialists are working feverishly to realise the value of a renewable energy source they had ignored for centuries.\n\nYashiri Nokogiyewa - Solara News Network</t>

The Split have directly countered this accusation, stating the Borons created huge profits for themselves, artificially inflating the market price of Spaceflies by setting up illegal 'safe zones' where massive swarms were commercially farmed. The Boron loudly disagreed, contending these were 'sanctuaries', not farms, and even then the Split attacked and stole vast numbers there as well.\n\nIt appears these two civilisations have more difficulties between them than just the Spaceflies to work out, but this is adding even more confusion and uncertainty to a new and tense situation. Aldrian scientists are saying they will be watching the Spacefly harvesting closely therefore, and will change the appropriate regulations as needed to protect the Spacefly numbers and keep them at sustainable levels. However, even this doesn't seem to have made the Boron happy, two Boron captains have also demanded permits so they can set up 'sanctuaries' here for Spacefly protection, and so it appears this dispute will go on.\n\nEmma Dorsett - Solara News Network</t>

This way, mercenaries can fly whatever ships they choose with less danger of attracting friendly fire, according to Solara Security who are pushing the idea. "With this in place, no ship will be seen as JUST Terran or Aldrian, the responder data will immediately show whether it is a private or military vessel and the new ID numbers are registered with both the Terran and Solara governments.

They don't go around causing fights and forcing their values onto others, so I expect Aldrians to treat them with the same respect as they have received from them."

The \033WTerran\033X \033WAmbassador\033X shook his 'hand' and welcomed him warmly, while the Aldrian representative just nodded and looked away.\n\nThe Queen herself has sent a personal message to emphasise that he has her complete respect and support in all political matters and any negotiations he might be called upon to mediate. This first Boron emissary will now start his real job of working with the colonists and corporations in the outer reaches, and also making a strong ally of the Solara government on \033WAldrin\033X, where he waits to be of assistance when needed. This now gives the Boron Kingdom a great advantage, as previous negotiations have sometimes stretched on endlessly, with discussions going back and forth across the distance of space, hampered by light-lag delayed communications. With the Queen's own representative here in the Expansion Region, diplomacy should be much improved in the future.\n\nLulu Gi - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

		<t id="1292">In \033WConrad\033X, a very unfortunate incident happened earlier this tazura. Having picked up supplies at Fuji Station, a Terran patrol was on its way back to their sector from Solara when they encountered an Aldrian fleet returning from their deep space mission. While this has occurred dozens of times, since the Terrans have been permitted to patrol their own areas in the Solara system, this time was different. One of the Aldrian ships inexplicably approached and locked weapons onto a Terran fighter, and this resulted in a short but violent exchange of fire lasting just three mizuras before a ceasefire could be agreed.\n\nThe Commander for the Aldrian patrol claims their man was targeted first, but the Terrans disagree and have produced cockpit recordings showing no such targeting occurring on their part. Flight data has now been demanded from the Aldrians to prove they were not at fault, but Solara Security have claimed their ships are not equipped sufficiently to provide such data. Whether this is true or not no one is sure, but a tense meeting between the Terran Ambassador and the head of Solara Security has been going on now for two tazuras with no signs of a resolution.\n\nMolo Pi - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

		<t id="1302">With the small military skirmish involving the Terrans and the Solara military just recently behind us, the Terran media has now called for an all out war against the Aldrian people! In a hastily removed article, they claimed any war would be quick and decisive and would solve all the problems they have been having with the Solara government. They don't understand Aldrian pride and honour too well at all it seems, and so they don't realise that the Aldrian people will not be talked to in this way. Any Terrans who think this will be quickly forgotten are sadly mistaken!\n\nIt is still under investigation who targeted or fired first in the attack, but the Terran's disgraceful attitude towards Aldrians is well-known, and when this investigation is over, it won't be a surprise to see that it was themselves that started this jingoistic rush to a war!\n\nSolara people prepare, this is far from over, and the Terrans will assuredly once again do something to provoke us.

The report from the joint investigation committee concluded that the Aldrians did indeed target a Terran fighter returning from a supply mission without due cause, and hence initiated the battle. After much public anger over this attack, even resulting in accusations of warmongering from some, this finally puts the matter to rest, once and for all. Both Terran and Solara governments have officially acknowledged these results to be accurate, and the Solara military has issued an interim report claiming the weapons fire had occurred due to a fault in their onboard combat software scripts.\n\nMorgan Brass - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="1332">The Boron Ambassador, \033WBolo\033X \033WHi\033X, has apologised to a Terran female for what she described as a "small pinch" she felt while he passed by. The "pinch", he admitted later, was from a small device he'd used to extract a tiny bit of DNA... hopefully without her knowledge, and as that had failed he apologised and offered to compensate her for any distress.\n\n"I don't know what he was thinking; after all we're not even the same species!" The woman said when asked what she thought of the matter, but the Ambassador had a curious further justification. "I have a personal interest in Human women," he said, quickly adding "but only in a very professional way. In our mythological past there have been reports of creatures, which inhabited distant seas on our worlds and looked surprisingly like Humans, and while many samples of Human male DNA have shown nothing, a few rare Aldrian female samples have sparked my interest. Whether that means they are related somehow, I still do not know, but my personal research has nothing to do with my job here as Ambassador, and again, I apologise for any upset or embarrassment caused. The genetics company promised using the probe would be painless, and you better believe they'll be hearing from me on this!"

While his private interests are a bit eccentric, he has always shown absolute professionalism towards everyone he meets."\n\nIf it's true that the Ambassador merely has a peculiar scientific curiosity, as inferred by the Boron Queen, then we see no problem with it, but he should at least ask courteously for DNA samples and not wander the streets and corridors randomly 'poking' females with a sampling device.\n\nSara Himes - Solara News Network</t>

They are selling clothing and badges emblazoned with "I was Boron probed, were you?" and "My other mother was a mermaid." It seems these items are all the fashion and they're flying off the shelves and into the arms of what appears to be a populace hungry for personal encounters with other races.\n\nWhen asked at his regular meeting this wozura about the craze, the Ambassador gushed with pride." I have so many women coming up to me and asking to be sampled I don't know what to do. I have to refuse some as they appear totally unlike the mermaids in visions from our past. It's possible with this deluge of samples I can now actually prove my theories!" he said happily as he floated away.\n\nThis is certainly a change of events, but the scandal does seem to have quietened down of late, even the recent messages sent by \033WQueen\033X \033WMenelaus\033X appear to show there are no hard feelings from anyone.

		<t id="1362">Despite all the publicity and amusement generated by the Boron Ambassador's alleged 'research', something even more controversial has now come to light. After wozuras of being a tabloid celebrity of sorts, the Ambassador was asked if "something else" was going on and he fairly gushed once again and explained: "One of my respected colleagues has asked for my help, and with well over 100 fresh DNA samples now, we are attempting to create a sample of hybrid Human/Boron genetic tissue to see what the possibilities are. Since Humans and Borons have been allies for generations, we feel this is an exciting and natural next step. Any resulting hybrid organism would be predominantly human-like, but with the Boron's resistance to the marine environment, very much like the legendary mermaids of the ancient past."\n\nWith this one announcement, the Ambassador has seemingly gone from a friendly, happy Boron diplomat to a mad scientist in the eyes of the non-scientific community. The spokesperson of the newly founded 'Aldrian Women Against Mad Boron Prober' declared, "If this was only about proving a theory, that'd be one thing, but to try and create a new species with donated samples, this is unheard of! We, the women of Solaria who volunteered to help him, are astounded by his sheer arrogance." Mistakenly, this new pressure group is under the impression the Boron scientist intends to create a living clone; in reality though, he is just working towards merging the genetic features of both races to permit the artificial growth of replacement organs and tissue, for use by those with serious injuries and internal organ failure.\n\nLoko To - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

An archaeologist from the \033WBoron\033X \033WAntiquities\033X \033WUniversity\033X says they appear to be some very ancient form of good luck charm, or perhaps a talisman to give protection to the ship carrying it.

It's possible the pilot of this vessel was a member of some cult or had some belief this object aided him in some way. In any case they are rare to see these tazuras as most people rely on personal skills and not luck for their protection."\n\nThe object was on display at the University for the past wozura and the public seemed very interested in it, as queues to view it went right around the building.\n\nGales Ton Li - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

The pirate had paid the bail money, walked free and then disappeared into uncharted space. Well, at last he has been found, and to no one's surprise, he's in command of yet another pirate base some sectors away.\n\nThe pirate's defence attorney was eventually dragged in and the judge ordered that the accused, self-proclaimed Commander \033WSitkamanckaslaat\033X, to return and face trial. The attorney however just smiled and said the request would be sent, as per their agreement, but it wasn't his responsibility whether the Commander returned or not. After this disappointing, but not unsurprising meeting outcome, the judge in charge of the case has placed a one hundred million credit bounty on \033WSitkamanckaslaat's\033X head for failing to report for trial.\n\nThere is a new law being proposed stating any suspected pirate officer brought in for trial will NOT be given the option to pay bail money and move freely until the trial is over.

The local Split representative demanded the weapon be returned, saying the warrior had paid good money for it and was simply showing it to some friends when Teladi security broke in and confiscated it.\n\n"The weapon involved is much too large to be carried around, even by the Split. If it accidentally fired inside a station, the whole section could be destroyed or at least kill all the inhabitants due to explosive decompression," said the Teladi police captain during a heated meeting with the Split representative.\n\n"This is a typical abuse of power, my people have a right to carry anything they want for self-protection," the Split representative had screamed in return, "while I admit it was a poorly chosen time to carry such a heavy weapon on board a station, having it confiscated will cost my constituent many credits he cannot afford!"\n\nAfter much argument, the Split plaintiff was financially compensated but the Teladi police held onto the weapon. The police captain said: "We have found out a Paranid weapons dealer is selling these and other armaments that we absolutely do not want the average person hauling around in Teladi space. As the Paranid currently have no representative here to discuss this, we are asking them to send or appoint one immediately, this kind of flagrant violation of our laws is a serious risk to profits!"

The cause of some public outrage however was that the Aldrian soldiers, who were also involved, only received a small fine and were immediately set free.\n\nWhile Sector Security seems very sure that justice has been done, the Terran Ambassador has called an emergency meeting of the Security Council to demand more even handed treatment for his men.

		<t id="1452">Over the last few wozuras, the constant power struggle between the Terrans and the Aldrians has caught the interest of many individuals from the Commonwealth races. A few citizens trying to enflame opinion in various ways have recently found a new way of expressing themselves on 'Extranet' social sites, places where tens of millions of beings of all races gather to waste time. A small excerpt follows of one article demonstrating the fallacious ideology behind a radical movement which has gained a large number of anonymous followers in cyber-space.\n\n"It has now been quite a while since our forces once again opened the gate into the \033WSolara\033X system and found, or should we say rediscovered, the colony of \033WAldrin\033X and its few scattered outposts. While it is true that they have survived on their own for centuries, it is because we as Terrans established the \033WAldrin\033X colony, and they survived and prospered because they are our descendants!\n\nSince they have been alone for such a long time, we have a certain amount of pride in the fact they survived at all, but still, the colony belongs to us as history plainly records. Even their DNA structure shows they are essentially Terran flesh and blood and we want only to bring them back into the 'fold' as it were, but NO... they stubbornly rebuke us. They say they are no one's colony, and they absolutely reject our authority and even the idea that we can help them. So great is their pride and stubbornness in their refusal of those who founded their entire civilization! This is unacceptable!\n\nWe feel the Aldrians need to stop and look at the facts, they ARE our ancestors, and we theirs. We did colonise \033WAldrin\033X and hence gave their ancestors the chance to lead better lives! When will they stop this senseless bickering and accept that they are all part of a greater good, and that we want to only receive them as brothers and sisters who have for so long, been alone? We hope understanding of this finally gets through to them soon, as we feel it is our duty to help them advance, and we WILL.... We have no problem with sharing our technology with them for their betterment, but we expect in return at least acknowledgment that we are family. Is that too much to ask after centuries of separation and isolation from us? I think not, and many other Terrans agree. We don't want a war between us, as this would in reality be a civil war and the most dreadful of conflicts imaginable, but we won't be turned away from our path by the few Aldrian "patriots" who would ruin any chance for reconciliation. This we pledge, "To bring our brothers back into the family" and we will weed out those responsible for their baseless animosity towards us."\n\nAs can be seen, many articles, while substantially longer and even more psychotic than this example, can be viewed as essentially a racial hate message, something which is strictly outlawed by most races. An investigation has been launched by the Argon Social Rights Department they promise the authors of this explicitly illegal message will be tracked down and taken into custody within a mazura.\n\nLess Warren - Interstellar Broadcast Company</t>

One of the main achievements so far is claimed to be the recent \033WOpen\033X \033WTrade\033X \033WPact\033X, a treaty that legally binds all races into an economic alliance, specifying that any manipulation of markets and taxes with the intent of severely harming the economy of another race can be classed as an act of war.

The Aldrians have pointed out that the Pact appears to allow an invading fleet to legally fly through their territory under the pretence of being a civilian merchant fleet.\n\nA compromise was put forward that it could be resolved by limiting all convoy escorts to no more than five fighters or one corvette, but the Terran diplomats quickly objected, stating that such a clause would apply not only to civilian traders, but also to military convoys as well. They stated that top secret technology was normally shipped using a military convoy and it was often far too valuable and dangerous to be allowed to leave dock without at least one destroyer, a carrier and several wings of fighters accompanying it.

The \033WBoron\033X \033WEnvironment\033X \033WProtection\033X \033WOffice\033X has issued a protest against the operation of more fusion power stations, reminding everyone about the catastrophic failures these plants have had in the past.\n\nBoli Ha - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

		<t id="1532">A squadron of Boron fighters that set off to the outer sectors last tazura on a routine patrol has not yet returned. This is a puzzling development, as it was considered a relatively safe patrol route and was flown every tazura, starting from the Boron core sectors and finishing in the outer regions of the recently charted sectors. As many as five patrols per tazura make similar flights, and so the mysterious disappearance is all the more troubling. If they did indeed find an enemy capable of destroying them so rapidly and completely that they didn't even manage to call for help, then other patrols are in severe danger as well.\n\nSecurity in the core sectors has once again been tightened up and in a bid to prevent further attacks, the Boron military has asked all traders to be more vigilant in watching for hostile ships. So far no evidence of what actually took place has been discovered, but patrols are out there even now seeking answers and clues that could shed light on the true events of this mysterious disappearance.\n\nJason Hicks - Interstellar Broadcast Company</t>

		<t id="1542">A mercenary, working for the Terran Fuji Station, has reported a hidden base in the \033WHoward\033X \033WAsteroid\033X \033WField\033X. Despite the station appearing empty with very little ship activity in the vicinity, the automated defences quickly became active, so he could only make a brief scan before having to leave the area. The base appears to be a munitions dump with many shipments of weapons and supplies that are either being accumulated for sale or for what is rumoured to be a war stockpile.\n\nThe Argon mercenary stated that he had informed his employers immediately so they could decide what to do about it. This clearly concerned the Terran commanders on Fuji station, as they have always claimed that the Aldrians were secretly hiding something. One thing is for certain however, this weapons cache probably doesn't belong to the Aldrians, as surely even they wouldn't be so foolish to hide it in such a crude and obvious manner.\n\nThe true owner of these weapons will probably remain a mystery for now, but an investigation has begun and it won't be closed until more information from official or other sources is received.\n\nJack Silarn - Interstellar Broadcast Corporation</t>

The first few sectors to be colonised have recently been officially recognised and many stations have already been constructed there to take advantage of these new regions. This is truly a historic time with new moons and asteroid fields containing high mineral and ore yields being discovered everywhere.\n\nWith the Aldrians being so completely self-sufficient, having run their own affairs alone for centuries, and the Terrans being so very intrepid and possessing great technology, it seems that there can be little justification to deny the right of the other Commonwealth races to expand in their own time, as long as the normal rights to ownership after discovery are preserved.

After many long hard meetings, the first draft of a basic agreement has finally been released that simply states: "All new AGI developments must be shown to all parties in and around Solara space before being put into operation." This is intended to allow scientists from all races to provide feedback as to what "improvements" should be made and whether any inherent hazardous risk is present, significant or not.\n\nThis seems like a small matter, but the Aldrians have long cherished their unrestricted use of AGI and they are making numerous plans to further technologically advance AGI. However, after dozens of stazuras of Terran vids being shown publicly of the true destructive power of AGI out of control, that ultimately resulted in the Xenon, a few members of the Council were finally swayed to vote for some minor restrictions.\n\nThe Terran Ambassador said after the meeting, his people have no wish to hold a complete veto over the Aldrian scientific community and their research, but the AGI devices employed by the Aldrians were potentially dangerous and posed a serious threat to all life. The Solara Security Council agreed that while uncontrolled AGI could pose a threat, both the present capability and any future AGI advances could never match the capability of evolution that the Terrans once gave to their Terraformer drones.\n\nSara Himes - Solara News Network</t>

With this initial agreement, compromise is slowly being achieved, and soon all parties are expected to move to a more comprehensive agreement on this matter. When that happens, then nothing should stand in the way of an enduring peaceful solution to these problems, and the long standing tension, so close to open conflict, will most likely subside and disappear.\n\nAccording to the Boron Ambassador, this is the true purpose of negotiations, to allow people to come together and openly speak their minds and make agreement with one another in a friendly manner.\n\nSpecial Report - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

Due to the colonisation of the Expansion Region, the politics of the Commonwealth has remained relatively unaffected but everyone is now being pulled into the power struggle between the two human factions. Many trade and military protocols have to be agreed with the full consent of all space-faring governments, and so the inability of the Terrans and the Aldrians to agree on a wide range of laws and treaties has been hampering the advancement of all other races.\n\nLately, there has been some improvement however, in no small part thanks to the efforts of the Boron and Argon diplomats, who have tried to act as intermediaries on the numerous issues that the Aldrians and Terrans are not able to agree upon. The recently signed \033WOpen\033X \033WTrade\033X \033WPact\033X is just one example of a compromise achieved only through relentlessness persistence combined with Machiavellian political and diplomatic manoeuvring. Even though political relations have been seen to improve of late, there still remains a great animosity between the Solara High Council and the Terran United Space Command. According to political analysts, with the unavoidable tensions created by rushed colonisations and the questions of what to do when external threats present themselves, like a massively organised pirate clan, the greatest political challenges are still yet to come.\n\nBen Hunt - GalNet News</t>

"We are losing ships every tazura due to breakdowns and hardware malfunctions, and worse still, good pilots are sitting around the docks doing nothing profitable when they could be out there right now, scanning for smugglers," the Teladi representative repeated to the news after the meeting.\n\nIt is thought that the agreement will allow heavy fighters, as a minimum, to be made available to experienced pilots who were until now deprived of new ships due to the mismanagement of police funding.

The hired group was ordered to halt any disruption of civilian trade lanes through the sector and after many losses; they decided that removing the base via secretly planted explosive charges was the most profitable way to complete the mission.\n\nThe team was made up Teladi and Split mercenaries, as well as a few Argon men and women. The base reportedly put up a good fight and launched more than 15 fighters to aid the laser towers in its defence, but to no avail. The base exploded during a siege lasting two tazuras, and after Teladi Profit Corps had made a sweep of the area to confirm the kill, the mercenary team was awarded a massive payout.\n\nTeladi police declared afterwards to news agencies that this was the first step in ridding the sectors of pirate influence that has been growing by leaps and bounds in the eastern section of the Commonwealth since the Terran Gate had opened, and the military had focused its attention on the Expansion Region and the cleansing of the \033WPirate\033X \033WDen\033X in \033WLoomanckstrat's\033X \033WLegacy\033X.

The economy has improved dramatically in many areas of Teladi space and the benefit is slowly working its way back into the core sectors. One Teladi station owner has said that with resources being at an all-time high and coming in ever faster, prices are dropping as supply shortages turn into a surplus. "It's a fantastic time to own a station, and with ample supplies and good security, we can make a great living for the first time in decazuras," said the station manager.\n\nThough the Teladi economy back home is experiencing a new boom, things are not going as smoothly as expected for the Boron. With only a small share of their money invested in Teladi enterprises, the rise of the Teladi economy has left them disadvantaged. With the excessive strain the territorial expansion has placed upon them, this may mean that the Boron will have to either auction off one or two of their border sectors in the Commonwealth, or cease further colonisation in the Expansion Region altogether, both of which would leave them weakened in the long run.\n\nAaron Sylveste - Interstellar Broadcast Company</t>

		<t id="1782">After the report published by the noted psychologist \033WDr.\033X \033WFrank\033X \033WGorshe\033Xn, a few people have already started to change the way they do business. Cheap meals and rooms for the night are now being offered at some stations to help pilots relax after long flights, and the Traders Guild has started instructing all pilots belonging to their Guild to take rest stops. While some are saying this is just a ploy by station owners to get pilots to spend their hard earned credits, others are saying that regardless of the real reason, these new guidelines will indeed help weary travellers to relax and make space travel safer for all. It was even said that certain other groups operating on these stations were offering 'special' deals to help reduce stress, however these reports have yet to be confirmed at this time.\n\nMojo Hi - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

		<t id="1792">With the recent claims about long duration space flights being the cause of wide-ranging and sometimes violent disorders, Argon scientists have stated that they completely refute this and offer their own contrary view. They claim that the Argon people have been in space longer \(arguably\) than any other race and rarely experience few or any issues with psychological problems due to space flight. Argon space research scientists have always insisted that proper training as well as discipline is essential for preparing a professional pilot to be ready for the hardship of space. They also point to other races which have been experiencing these psychological problems for jazuras, inferring that it was probably their inadequate training programmes that were to blame and not lengthy space flights.\n\nWhile accidents in the Argon military do occur from time to time, all incidents are reported and properly investigated, and as such, there have been no recorded problems to date with Argon space personnel that can only be explained by \033WDr.\033X \033WGorshen's\033X hypothesis.\n\nTimothy Langley - Interstellar Broadcast Company</t>

		<t id="1802">While contracts often require mercenaries to perform tasks normal or law abiding citizens wouldn't, these are often over looked as 'just business' by many corporations and other organisations across the galaxy. However a recent story on mercenary activities has shown a certain individual not only fulfilled his contract, but he went way beyond what is considered reasonable, and worse still, wilfully engaged in the slow torture of a corporate official he was supposed to 'just retire'.\n\nThe contract, like many others issued each mazura all over the galaxy, was for a simple assassination, but the mercenary who accepted the mission had other ideas. After skilfully scattering the target convoy and its escorts, he kidnapped the official and then took him to a secure location where he slowly tortured him to death. Only the testimony of a station worker who heard the screams of the unfortunate man led the Aldrian authorities to the torture room located in a small storage area rented to the mercenary involved.\n\nSolara Security has made us remove the names of both the mercenary and his victim from this report to allow for a thorough investigation of matter, and also to stop family relatives from seeking revenge on the family of the mercenary involved.\n\nSara Himes - Solara News Network</t>

		<t id="1812">Political tensions between the leading Split families are getting more serious by the stazura. Over the three tazuras that have passed since the expansion begun, there have been more than thirteen assassination attempts against the Patriarch and the heads of Family Zrt and Scct, both of which are gaining immense power with their new territories. Just last wozura, the personal cruiser of the \033WPatriarch\033X \033WRhonkar\033X himself was assaulted by a small pirate raiding force using rare disruptor missiles which disabled the cruiser's engines completely. Naturally, they lacked the necessary firepower to do any serious harm to the Patriarch's flagship, and the turret batteries took care of all the attackers within a few mizuras.\n\nCurrently, it is thought that this might of been a last act of desperation by one of the lesser Split clans. Sceptics suggest that the pirates could not have obtained the resources to create the modified disruptors, implying that a more powerful Split family might be behind this operation. Naturally, there is no proof to support such assumptions, and the attack therefore must just be a simple coincidence. \n\nSnt t'Kggh - Split Clan News</t>

The history of living quarters hasn't always been so rosy, at first they were nothing more than a small basic area available only to those who could afford the actual station they were built within. However as technology steadily improved, they became better and more luxurious as more people owned stations and lived there in comfort when their fortunes grew.\n\nSuch is the way of things currently, if you can afford a station, even your first, you'll be rewarded with a fine and comfortable place to live and those tazuras of hard work will seem less stressful than before.

		<t id="1841">Solara ship production crisis</t>
		<t id="1842">The Aldrian approach to spacecraft design has always been focused on superior speed above everything else, but this has now become outmoded in comparison with the ships used by the so called 'Commonwealth' races. With the installation of so many Trans-Orbital Accelerators in our systems, the Commonwealth ships appear to be better suited for travel within the small areas joined by gates such as now, favouring greater shielding and offensive power to protect themselves with their relatively low speed against the threats from piracy throughout Solara space.\n\nOver the past two jazuras, unable to compete with the competition introduced by the new inhabitants of the Expansion Region, \033WSolara\033X \033WGovernment\033X owned ship production wharfs have slowly gone into bankruptcy. The highly competitive pricing of the new Commonwealth vessel types means that if Aldrian shipyards are to remain financially viable, they would have to sell every ship for only half the amount it costs to produce. In an unrelated but fateful decision, it was decided two wozuras ago, that all inactive mineral mines that had been previously used to sustain our economy would be sold to private entrepreneurs and open for free trade with the public, focusing heavily on exports instead of trade within the home market. With the activities of the major raw material suppliers directed elsewhere and the demand for their merchandise almost non-existent, the Aldrian shipyards are consequently facing their biggest financial crisis ever experienced since the infamous management crisis 400 jazuras ago.\n\nExpert economists and commercial enterprises are being forced to re-invent themselves during this change, from operating in a completely closed and government controlled economy, to an individualistic and highly opportunist free market founded on the uninhibited trade that occurred with the arrival of the Terrans in our section of the universe. It has been said that our workforce's inability to change with the times has led our economy to become completely dependent on purely import and export commerce. Despite the dire economic appearance however, we hope that this will only be a temporary state of affairs as things change for the better over the coming jazuras, leading to thousands of new work positions, exceptional new ship designs and more efficient production techniques.\n\nKaren Styles - Solara News Network</t>

		<t id="1851">Solara ship production industry dies</t>
		<t id="1852">Ever since re-establishing contact with the Solara system, it has been noticed just how grossly inefficient and inflexible their economy is. In these recent tazuras, we can see that the only possible outcome to their dire situation has now arrived. Reliant completely on government subsidies and a highly regulated, pre-determined supply capacity, all Aldrian ship manufacturing has now gone belly up and a complete cessation within the whole industry has been officially declared.\n\nAldrian vessels are completely unsuitable for Advanced Jump Gate and Orbital Accelerator-based space transit technologies, their ship production quality is way below any recognisable level of acceptability plus they are exceptionally expensive and resource intensive to produce in large quantities. In a free market economy, their archaic business practice methodologies and outdated technology cannot hope to match our advanced industrial expertise, and now it's rendered them unable to compete with us at any given level. Increasingly, most trading in their raw resources are exports to outside of Solara space, and a number of our own businessmen have finalised exceptional deals that allow the importation of raw materials for nearly half their normal market price. This will ensure an even further boost to our own economy, and as an added bonus, it will ensure Aldrian dependence upon us, rendering them ever more vulnerable to our wishes.\n\nA large number of market analysts employed by the Economic Division of the \033WTerran\033X \033WMorning\033X \033WNews\033X say that all this was an inevitable occurrence and just shows the fatal flaws inherent within the whole Solara economy. The majority of pro-Terran activists think that it will not be too long before the much vaunted independence of \033WSolara\033X will just be a thing of the past, and they will have to once more acknowledge their colonial status and re-integrate themselves back into the Terran community.\n\nEmma Whi - Terran Morning News</t>

		<t id="1861">No more new Aldrian ships?</t>
		<t id="1862">The Solara economy is undergoing an extremely painful period of restructuring, and it has been obvious to most experts that the ship production industry would be the first to suffer. Developed originally as a state controlled monopoly, it has proved to be highly inefficient when compared to the well established businesses and free market trading techniques used among the races of the Commonwealth. Terran newspapers have claimed that the entire Aldrian ship industry has been destroyed by the competition, a fact that is largely exaggerated and barely rational. While it is true that a great number of shipyards have been closed down and the production of several types of ships have ceased completely, this is not the end, just a necessary and intermediate stage in their evolution. Some of the best Teladi market analysts have studied the heavy production industries of \033WSolara\033X for quite some time, and have arrived at the conclusion that nothing but a complete reorganisation will yield positive results for the future, and create the opportunities for further development and expansion.\n\nAccording to the Teladi specialists, some of the most interesting recent observations are the extremely low prices at which the Aldrians appear to be selling their raw materials to Terran corporations, an action which may lead to the complete destabilisation of the whole Terran economy. Just as significant is the large number of leading Aldrian ship design companies that have inexplicably purchased scores of various Commonwealth ships, quite possibly in a bid to dismantle and analyse their structural design to gain a new understanding to further their own ship development plans.\n\nGiven the wide range of new technologies now available to the Aldrians, it seems only a matter of time until they return industrially as strong as before, unless of course they choose to stick to their old ways. This may be a grave crisis for the Aldrian ship construction sector at present, but if they do everything right, it may also be the foundation and the beginning for a whole new ship building industry in the future.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="1871">Spying devices found in Terran Embassy!</t>
		<t id="1872">The deceitfulness of Terran diplomats has been laid bare with a shocking discovery made by Solara Secret Service agents. During the ninth examination this mazura of the new Terran Embassy building on \033WAldrin\033X, a powerful radio wave emitter was discovered within the large insignia that serves as a decoration on the forefront of the main building. Upon closer examination, a number of spying devices were also found to be deeply embedded in the core structure of the building itself. All the discovered devices were pointing towards Solara government buildings that reside in the same district, and so without a doubt, they had been deliberately placed there to spy on the sensitive meetings and classified conferences that occur regularly nearby. It's rumoured that that the Embassy staff had always switched off the various secret contraptions, just before the routine examination, so as to avoid detection and that's why they had not been discovered until now. Since the inspection this time unexpectedly occurred two tazuras ahead of the agreed schedule, the culprits were totally unprepared for such a turn of events and were caught out.\n\nThe \033WAldrin\033X \033WGovernment\033X has demanded that the \033WTerran\033X \033WEmbassy\033X building be demolished and a new one built on the very outskirts of the capital city, a place that is known to be only inhabited by the dregs of Aldrian society... a fitting place for the Terrans, according to some Aldrians. So far the Terran Ambassador has denied any knowledge of either the listening devices or the transmission equipment. In fact going further, he has also rejected the demands to allow the authorities on Aldrin to position Solara Secret Service staff within the Terran Embassy on constant surveillance duty, claiming that the Embassy grounds are legally recognised as sovereign territory and not subject to any local jurisdiction.\n\nThis pitiful excuse was quickly rebuked by the Chief Constable of the Solara Secret Service, stating that if this was indeed true, he would be more than pleased to install defensive heavy plasma cannons and air defence missile launchers within the grounds of the Solara Embassy located on \033WEarth\033X. The Terrans have yet to react to this, but a fair number of Aldrian politicians eagerly await to see what nonsensical response they come up with in order not to lose the last vestiges of respect among the political elite.\n\nKaren Styles - Solara News Network</t>

		<t id="1881">Aldrians threaten Terran territory!</t>
		<t id="1882">The Solara Secret Service has crossed the line this wozura, demanding that the Terran Embassy on \033WAldrin\033X should be demolished and rebuilt elsewhere in their capital city among the sewage recycling plants. They claim that they have found elaborate spying devices built into the Embassy itself, completely overlooking the fact that the building was constructed by them and used as the National Bank for ten jazuras before the Terran government purchased the ownership rights from the Aldrin authorities. Outrageously, their Secret Service agents entered the Embassy grounds before the officially agreed inspection time and without gaining permission, a federal offence that will surely cost them their jobs. Furthermore, these so-called spying devices that the Aldrians supposedly detected, are actually nothing more than internal security cameras that are used for basic protection against petty thieves and vandals, they are physically unable to penetrate anything thicker than a sheet of paper.\n\nThe Aldrian Ambassador has kicked up a major fuss during this so-called espionage scandal, and has demanded explanations from us about the surveillance equipment that they themselves installed, but what's even worse, the leader of their quasi-official Solara SS agency has now threatened to place weapons of mass destruction at the Solara Embassy that is located on Earth. Our Terran diplomats were so understandably outraged by this suggestion that they have refused any more comment on this for the moment, but have for now issued an official request that the Solara SS leader is removed from his position, and an official apology is made, otherwise this unjustifiable threat will be taken as a provocation of war.\n\nEmma Whi - Terran Morning News</t>

		<t id="1891">Terran-Aldrian diplomatic crisis, over nothing?</t>
		<t id="1892">Earlier this wozura, a major diplomatic crisis arose in the Expansion Region on the basis of unfounded rumours that the Terrans had supposedly installed secret spying devices within their Embassy building on \033WAldrin\033X. There are also unsubstantiated claims that the Aldrians have supposedly threatened to install weapon systems at their Embassy on \033WEarth\033X in retaliation as a result. It is unknown where these stories originated from, but the \033WSolara\033X \033WNews\033X \033WNetwork\033X featured reports from the 'Solara Secret Service Agency' - an organisation which does not appear to be an officially recognised group or an existing part of either the Solara Government or Municipal Bureau.\n\nThere seem to be vague stories of some kind relating to regular examinations of the Embassy buildings, a concept which is as ridiculous as it is impossible, since it is common knowledge that each respective government is in full legal ownership and control of its Embassy grounds regardless of its actual physical location. The really interesting thing however, is that there is no factual evidence officially available in the public domain on either of these matters. In fact, the only information sources that have seem to have knowledge of these events so far, are the extremist newspapers of both factions, the 'Terran Morning News' and the 'Solara News Network,' both of which are known to distort basic facts quite regularly and often resort to outright lies.\n\nPress experts claim that both these two media groups have no concept or understanding of what a proper news service should be like, they have very lax editorial control and heavy censorship affects most of their articles.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="1901">Teladi ask to re-open the Pandora Gate</t>
		<t id="1902">The Teladi Chamber of Commerce representatives within Solara space have issued an official plea to the Terrans to re-enable the \033WPandora\033X \033WGate\033X and link the Expansion Region with the Commonwealth once again. They claim that the isolation is not profiting anyone at all and is contrary to the primary goal which lay behind the colonisation of the new territories. According to the market analyst \033WAdaraos\033X \033WSitiraras\033X \033WTomulilis\033X \033WII\033X, the ability to use the resources of the Expansion Region to boost the economy of the Commonwealth was the main purpose of the whole project. Now, with the exportation of resources essentially halted, there is no real reason to keep blindly expanding outwards in competition with the others races simply to colonise new areas of space, this would only result in financial loss in the short term and little benefit in the long run. Terran officials have said that the \033WPandora\033X \033WGate\033X will remain locked and inoperative for an undisclosed length of time, and that no pleas from other races will change their minds on this matter.\n\nBefore the Teladi request, no other Commonwealth faction had expressed the desire for the Pandora Gate to re-open. For instance, a Boron spokesman, \033WMolono\033X \033WGu\033X, claimed that the Boron Government respects the Terran decision in this regard and is more than happy to focus on further exploration and expansion instead of just settling for one or two new sectors. The opinion of the general populace however seems both ill informed and rather laid-back on this matter; the majority of people living in the Expansion Region have moved their entire families here and are too preoccupied, and anxious, at settling in to worry about their old home planets.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="1912">The supposedly famous Terran show, called 'Down to Earth', was performed live at the Grand Opera House on \033WAldrin\033X last wozura. Supposedly a satirical comedy with various performers acting out amusing historical events, in reality it turned out to be nothing more than a lame attempt at converting Aldrian youth through Terran demagogy. Filled with racial stereotypes and an overbearing theme that the Terran people are superior and should be treated as such above all others, it provoked severe riots during the live performance itself. The enraged crowd decimated the stage completely and attacked the politically biased actors in a just display of anger and retribution. Afterwards, as the news spread to other cities, a small group of protesters gathered in front of the Terran Embassy to voice their opinion about this disgraceful show and its offensive propaganda, and this finally culminated in a demand being peacefully issued requesting that all the performers leave Solara space within 24 stazuras if not sooner. Shortly afterwards, a private shuttle was seen leaving the sector and heading towards Terran occupied territories. It was escorted by a large number of military ships in a completely unnecessary display of arrogance and self-importance by the USC.\n\nThe Solara Ambassador has asked for an official apology for this unprecedented and deplorable play, as well as issuing an official notice declaring that forthwith the Terran Government had no further legal rights to transmit any digital content that was considered to contain unfitting material or scenes. So far, the relevant authorities have already banned 75% of all content from Terran entertainment media channels, claiming that they are harmful to the younger audiences and contain numerous subliminal messages.\n\nKaren Styles - Solara News Network</t>

		<t id="1922">In a rare display of good will, the Terran Government sponsored the famous comedy show 'Down to Earth' to be performed live in Solara space. Known for its witty political satire and exceptionally high quality material, it was expected to be the biggest cultural event that the Aldrians have experienced since the initial colonisation of the \033WSolara\033X system. Unfortunately though, it seems that the Aldrian people have all lost their ability to appreciate real comedy gold when they get it.\n\nShortly after the fourth scene had started, a violent mob set fire to the theatre and savagely attacked the renowned comedians, who barely escaped with their lives, suffering several injuries as they ran. If it hadn't been for the brave bodyguards assigned from the Terran military, they would have been killed before even leaving the premises. A few moments later, an even greater mob carrying torches, smoke bombs and bladed weapons attacked the Terran Embassy, screaming various slogans and demanding that the artists leave Solara space within two stazuras, otherwise they would be lynched on sight. Needless to say, the artists were appalled at such hate towards this altruistic attempt in cultural bonding, and they left the \033WAldrin\033X sector at once, heading towards \033WTerminus\033X. They were escorted by a small number of Terran fighters, assigned to act as a protection for the convoy. No violent incidents occurred on route, but the escorts did note that a suspiciously high number of heavily armed gunships followed right at the edge of their scanner range and trailed them all the way through Solara space.\n\nEmma Whi - Terran Morning News</t>

The rioters initially tried to attack the leading artists and chased them out of the Opera House premises, but having failed in their attempt to seriously injure the comedians, they then rallied together a larger number of people outside the Terran Embassy, where the performers had fled seeking sanctuary. The civilians eventually started a riot in front of the Embassy, and two stink bombs were launched from the crowd through the open windows of the building. The ringleaders of the mob finally demanded that the artists had to leave Solara space within the tazura or there would be further and even more violent consequences.

		<t id="1941">Aldrian Society Research \(Part 1\)</t>
		<t id="1942">This is the first instalment of a short series of excerpts taken from a research paper on Aldrian culture and society by \033WDoctor\033X \033WWarren\033X \033WJames\033X of \033WPluto\033X \033WAcademy\033X.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Aldrian people have been living in total isolation and separation from us for more than 800 jazuras. It is not wise therefore to assume that their social development can be compared to our own culture in any way. I have travelled to Aldrian settlements, lived among them and studied their ways and peculiarities. Over the course of one jazura, I have gained much insight into their way of life, and now I share this information with you, the reader.\n\nThe Aldrian Family\n\nThe average Aldrian family has the same basic composition as those within our own society, with two parents and two to four children forming the nucleus of a typical family unit. The main difference however, in this closed society containing no more than a few million individuals at any given time, is that in order to avoid inbreeding, the children are forced to marry others not based on their own preferences, but rather on their ancestry, genetic vigour and from any status that their parents enjoy. Over time during the Aldrian's long isolation, incredibly large family networks spanning across many individuals has resulted, and it's not uncommon to find almost all Aldrian children will have no less than six cousins and more than 40 relatives of different kinds. This is a result of strict marital laws that were initially made to preserve the life of the whole colony, but in reality it has led to a gradual degradation of society and a return to almost tribal-like hierarchy.\n\nElder members of families are held in high esteem regardless of their actual wisdom or knowledge, and they have the absolute right to settle disputes, resolve feuds and generally decide the fates of others. I have seen how donations and tributes are bought to old folks who are held in almost sacred regard within closed communities that are defined only by city block borders. It is almost too easy to draw parallels from this to the dawn of mankind, when such a social structure was the pinnacle of our civilisation. In effect, this has led to the near complete redundancy of the judicial system and consequently Aldrian laws often demonstrate deference to the eccentricities of this tribal system. For example, there is an Aldrian law that states that a marriage cannot be conducted without the agreement of the Grandparents of the bride and the groom. Note that the word "grandparents" is written with a capital letter, almost as if to acknowledge their position as official dignitaries.\n\nSurely such a culture cannot be expected to be held up as an equal to our own liberal society with its egalitarian justice system. The Aldrians cannot hope to match our high standards with such a primitive family power structure and subservient justice system.\n\nExcerpt from "A Treatise on Aldrian Society" by Dr. W. James</t>

		<t id="1951">Aldrian Society Research \(Part 2\)</t>
		<t id="1952">Justice and Law\n\nThe Aldrian justice system is nothing more than a warped and twisted mockery of justice as we know it. In \033WSolara\033X, a citizen has no real rights when it comes to civil and criminal matters. The governing elite and municipal forces have the authority to arrest and kill you, even if you only dared to glance in their general direction. You have the supposed right to settle any conflict in a court of law, but this is all just for mere show. The jury are always handpicked by the government, and all witnesses are forced to spend two nights of "deliberation" in municipal custody themselves, where they are often beaten and coerced to change their testimony always in favour of the state. The so-called 'confession tape' technique is often used, and it entails the accused being intimidated and sometimes tortured, and once their spirit is broken, they are is forced to make a fake confession in front of a video recorder which is then widely broadcast on public media channels.\n\nA regular occurrence is the disappearance of people who are deemed hazardous to the welfare of the general populace. Indeed, most of my local contacts simply vanished during the course of my research, and in some cases, their remains were found in various places all over the Solara system. The \033WSecret\033X \033WService\033X \033WAgency\033X, which is not officially overseen by any government department, seems to have total access and control over everything and everyone. Such a thing as personal privacy is truly a pipe-dream in \033WSolara\033X.\n\nAs their laws did not consider alien contact a possibility before the re-discovery of \033WAldrin\033X, new laws were immediately enacted, stating that in all cases every non-Aldrian is primarily considered to be the guilty party when in dispute with an Aldrian citizen. Naturally, these laws are not publicly enforced widely out of pure fear from the possible retaliation of the Terran and other governments, but this xenophobic ethos does now seem to pervade all areas of their so called justice system.\n\nExcerpt from "A Treatise on Aldrian Society" by Dr. W.

		<t id="1962">Culture and Language\n\nThe cultural life of Aldrian citizens is practically nonexistent, all innovation and creativity is monitored by the government, and only what is deemed acceptable is ever released to the public. Such concepts as art seems completely lost on the Aldrians and there has been a continual degeneration of their society for 800 jazuras, in fact, it can probably be said that their entire culture is on the brink of collapse. When compared to the Terran civilisation with its lush art exhibitions, theatres and social events, the Aldrians have nothing worth mentioning. Their sole artistic pleasure is being permitted to go to the so-called Opera Houses, in which the audience is more than likely to be literally assaulted by high-pitched squeals that originate from a pig-like human-shaped android, but there are no substance to these performances, no message and no inherent meaning.\n\nAldrian youth is even more adrift in this cultural vacuum, their idea of social interaction equals one night out each wozura with their peers consuming dangerously high amounts of alcoholic and narcotic substances, rendering them practically unconscious for the next two tazuras. They appear to show a passing respect to their elders, but only out of apathy rather than free will. Their language is foul and corrupted and consists of basic words no more than four syllables long, and they then combine this with jargon and vulgar expressions when communicating with others of their kind. It is difficult to even consider them to be human beings due to all these negative qualities, and it makes me wonder just what kind of adults they can ever become. Perhaps in every Aldrian there lies a foul-mouthed, uneducated and arrogant youth?\n\nIn any event, it is now clear that Aldrian society is a degenerate mess that cannot hold a candle to the glorious Terran civilisation. Aldrian values are a charade, their customs and traditions are primitive and tribal, and their youth simply cannot evolve into proper and respected members of a functional society. It is worth considering this, how can we ever consider the Aldrians as equals, when they are so clearly inferior to us in every respect? Yes, it is true that they have the same origins as we do, but it seems that our two societies have gone in almost opposite directions ever since the divide. Whereas we, the Terrans, have evolved and enhanced our existence, the Aldrians have regressed, effectively nullifying any progress mankind had achieved before their separation from us.\n\nI propose that we should seriously consider future dominion over the Aldrian citizens for their own good, and forcefully re-educate them, so that we can re-integrate them back into a meaningful civilised society. We clearly cannot afford to let them live on their own, since they have proven themselves to be completely incapable of running their own affairs. They are not Terrans anymore, and from their ideology and actions, they seem barely human. They are clearly inferior to us in every way imaginable.\n\nExcerpt from "A Treatise on Aldrian Society" by Dr. W. James</t>

		<t id="1972">In recently published research papers written by a certain \033WDoctor\033X \033WW.\033X \033WJames\033X, the Aldrian people were described as backwards, degenerate and inferior to the Terrans, as well as being unable to form an enlightened, rational society. This has caused great outrage and anger among the people of Solara, and our Ambassador has requested that the Terrans must hand over Doctor James into Aldrian custody immediately, where he will be charged with committing a racial crime against Solara itself.\n\nSo far, the Terrans have denied any knowledge of this person, and have even gone so far as to produce obviously fake documents showing the employee lists at Pluto University, where this Dr. James claims to work. His publication has now been banned in Solara and even by some of the other alien races too - an obvious sign that this published work is nothing more than a hateful and pathetic piece made up by an unintelligent, xenophobic, imperialistic and senile old man.\n\nOn behalf of the 'Terran Morning News', the Terran Government has apologised for any offence given and declared that they will seriously investigate this matter in order to repair the damage that the printed articles have done to Terran-Solara relations.\n\nKaren Styles - Solara News Network</t>

		<t id="1981">Terran essay on Aldrian society banned</t>
		<t id="1982">Recently, a series of insulting and inflammatory articles were broadcast by the \033WTerran\033X \033WMorning\033X \033WNews\033X network, all being sourced from a research paper on Aldrian society by a Terran academic named \033WW.\033X \033WJames\033X. After careful analysis, all non-human political experts agree that this work is clearly a fake, and made up simply to provoke racial hatred against the Aldrians.\n\nThe government authorities from all five of the Commonwealth races have banned this Terran material in their own territories on the grounds of it breaking a number of laws relating to the basic respect afforded to sentient beings. Argon spokesman, \033WDan\033X \033WSlammer\033X, said in a recent interview that he will never support the Terran government while it allows such injustices to be propagated from their own media networks. The Boron have reacted in an even harsher fashion, with a number of them abandoning their contracted work assignments and leaving Terran space, essentially halting a large number of trade and political deals, claiming that they find it intolerable to work with people who have no respect for others of their own kind. This issue is the most serious crisis of late between the Terran and the Aldrian nations, and it will most likely not be resolved with just a mere apology.\n\nDolo Gi - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

		<t id="1992">The Terran Ambassador has officially issued a long and wide-ranging apology over the recently broadcast essays of \033WDr.\033X \033WW.\033X \033WJames\033X that appeared to be no more than a disgraceful and hateful attempt to insult the Aldrian people. The Ambassador also claimed that his Government has no information as to who Dr. W. James really is or why the Chief Editor of \033WTerran\033X \033WMorning\033X \033WNews\033X had even allowed this material to be transmitted in the first place.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the Ambassador didn't specifically promise that the material would be removed from their media networks, and so far there seems to be no indication on the part of the Terran Government to follow the example of all other races and ban the material completely. While political tensions have cooled down a bit after this shameful episode, many Aldrian people are still voicing anger against Terran bigotry and some are demanding that Dr. W. James be found and given over to the Aldrian people for lynching. Moreover, the editorial staff of the Solara News Network have asked if the Terran Media Control Agency can severely punish the Terran Morning News media network, and prevent their staff from making any further slanderous broadcasts by all means available to them.\n\nKaren Styles - Solara News Network</t>

		<t id="2041">Terrans increase border tension</t>
		<t id="2042">Over the course of the last few wozuras, Aldrian intelligence agencies have noticed an alarming increase in the numbers and strength of Terran patrols on our borders. When a Terran military spokesman was asked recently the reason for these reinforcements, he refused to give a full explanation, but commented that it was an internal Terran affair and should be of no concern to outsiders. The patterns and types of Terran border patrols has changed significantly lately; they have deployed far more assault craft, such as heavy bombers and frigates in the place of the more usual corvettes and fighter wings. All this is being considered by our authorities as a possible pre-cursor to a hostile incursion, when taken along with the recent decline in our relations with them. This is a worrying turn of events, as with the ever present threat of a full scale Terran invasion of the \033WSolara\033X system, the \033Aldrin\033X \033Defence\033X \033Force\033X is spread too thinly and they are forced to ignore the more routine problems in the core sectors just to ensure the security and defence of our borders.\n\nSNN managed to get some time with Aldrin Defence Force pilot \033WNokoshira\033X \033WYamoto\033X, flying with the \033WDelta\033X \033WWing\033X \033WSquadron\033X. Here is his take on the events: "The current situation is very threatening to us for reasons I cannot disclose right now. Although Terran forces have been gathering for some time on our borders, their activity over the last wozura has been getting more and more confrontational. It is clear that these are exactly the tactics a military force would use to prepare for an invasion. But we are no fools; we have bolstered our defences and devised a number of key strategies for such an occurrence. Rest assured that if it comes down to action, we will kick their sorry asses and smear them all over the asteroids."\n\nSo, there you have it... Strong words from a brave person, a person willing to risk and even give his life for \033WSolara\033X. A man truly devoted to the right cause.\n\nKaren Styles - Solara News Network</t>

		<t id="2051">Security patrols bolstered on borders</t>
		<t id="2052">Over the past few wozuras, the Internal Defence Division of the Terran military has received extra ships from the United Space Command, and these forces have been assigned to patrol the Terran-Aldrian borders. It had been observed that a large number of pirate ships as well as illegal immigrants have been crossing the borders without permission from our government, and with the deployment of these new bombers and frigates, the patrolling forces are now considered to be a strong enough deterrent against these unwarranted incursions.\n\nWe have also learned from our sources in the military, that another reason for boosting the border patrols was the threat that the Aldrians pose to our outer sectors. The Solara military has been covertly gathering large forces in the outer regions of Solara, leaving their home sectors practically unguarded. The military strategists are baffled at this turn of events, as there has been no provocation from our side. A number of patrol pilots have said that perhaps the Aldrians are preparing for an offensive, and if this is true, then our border forces need to be increased even further to be prepared for all eventualities.\n\nIn a special press debriefing session, the USC internal strategist had this to say: "We do not know what game the Solara military forces are trying to play. We will not give into their explicit provocation, and we do not feel threatened by their manoeuvrings at all. The on-going reinforcement of our border patrol forces is something we have been planning for mazuras, and it is just a small part of a greater plan that we have been meaning to execute for quite some time now. It is certainly not a response to the most recent Aldrian activities... we are not so petty as to stoop to their level. Soon, more information will be released to the public and then you will all finally be able to see what we have been up to, and what our current strategy is."\n\nEmma Whi - Terran Morning News</t>

		<t id="2082">The long planned joint military training operation that was supposed to inspire a sense of unity among all races in the Expansion Region has ended in disaster. Shortly after commencing manoeuvres, a Terran frigate experienced a severe navigational system malfunction and drifted straight into the side of an Aldrin corvette, nearly destroying it. A few mizuras later, an Aldrin fighter squadron accidentally launched a number of heavy torpedoes at an Argon frigate, a Boron destroyer and one of their own civilian stations that was being towed through the sector nearby. The two battleships survived the impact, thanks to their military grade shields, but the station, which was without shielding at the time, was completely destroyed. Fortunately, no lives were lost during these events, but both Terran and Aldrin military forces have stated that they will never again repeat such an attempt at joint military training.\n\nA full enquiry into these unfortunate incidents will be carried out by a special investigative team consisting of an equal number of trained experts from all six factions. The interim results from this are expected to be published within two mazuras.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2092">The Aldrian-hosted joint military training operation that was conceived to bring the leading factions of the Expansion Region together, has ended in a massive disaster. A Terran frigate veered off course shortly after the beginning of the tactical manoeuvring trial and crashed into our corvette, severely damaging it beyond repair. Moments later, as if following pre-planned orders, a Terran bomber squadron launched dumb-fire torpedoes at an Argon frigate and a Boron destroyer, nearly destroying them both, as well as at an Aldrian station that was being towed through the sector on route for repairs. The station, alas, did not survive, and over 50 lives were lost when an entire maintenance crew was killed in the fierce explosion.\n\nAn investigation has already begun, and our contacts within the \033WAldrin\033X military claim that it is currently suspected that a powerful pirate clan, which is known to be friendly with the Terrans, is behind this malicious sabotage attempt. Here is a direct quote received from our most trustworthy of sources: "It is clear that this was no mere accident. The sheer precision of the timing and execution of the attacks are strong indications that this was, in fact, a successful sabotage attempt. \033WSNN\033X sources have claimed that the pirates are behind this, but there are also reasons to suspect Terran involvement in this as well. \033WSNN\033X will keep you informed on any further developments."\n\nKaren Styles - Solara News Network</t>

		<t id="2102">The recent combined military training exercise incorporating forces from all the major races, organised by the United Space Command, was disrupted shortly after the initial manoeuvres when a series of unfortunate incidents resulted in the damage of several ships and the destruction of an entire station.\n\nFirstly, the navigational computer of the Terran frigate 'Intrepid' was hacked into and reset for a ramming course with an Aldrin military corvette. The crash resulted in severe shield generator damage for both ships as well as loss of hull integrity for the corvette. Even more inexplicably three mizuras later, all the onboard computers within an entire Aldrin fighter squadron simultaneously launched several torpedo volleys at an Argon frigate, a Boron destroyer and an Aldrian station that was being towed through the sector for renovation. The military ships survived thanks to their brand new shields that were developed with the expertise of the Terran Research and Development Institute, but the station did not survive the attack and was completely incinerated.\n\nA special investigation team has been created to determine the cause of this tragedy and to find out who is responsible for this suspected act of terrorism. Although the first interim findings are expected to be published in two mazuras, unofficial sources have already said that this is probably the work of a powerful pirate clan that has historically been operating in the Expansion Region over a relatively long period of time.\n\nEmma Whi - Terran Morning News</t>

		<t id="2112">Several freighter captains have recently reported that they have experienced intense and unpleasant vibrations when travelling through the Orbital Accelerators that the Solara government bought from the Terrans. A diagnostic engineering team was eventually sent to investigate these complaints and they have found multiple structural faults in the core of the accelerators. They report that the acceleration field is resonating with the magnetic fluctuations which emanate from the super-massive black hole that resides at the core of our galaxy, and over the two jazuras of extensive use, the uncalibrated magnetic coils embedded within the structure have shifted, resulting in an increasingly dangerous deviation of the acceleration vectors.\n\n\033WSNN\033X has been told that if this issue had not have been discovered during the next three mazuras, transiting ships would have smashed into the side of the receiving accelerator upon exiting. Since no such issues have been reported on any Orbital Accelerators in non-Solara territories, the Solara Safety Council has demanded an explanation from the Terrans as to why the Solara sectors have been equipped with faulty transport systems.\n\nKaren Styles - Solara News Network</t>

It appears therefore, that a large percentage of the Aldrian populace are essentially stuck on their home planets and unable to start new lives as traders or mercenaries, or even travel to another sector. There are currently no government programmes to help alleviate this situation, and even those people who can afford to take out a loan for the purchase of a new ship, are left waiting in line for many jazuras. With the current regulations being what they are, an Aldrian citizen has to undergo hundreds of various tests and examinations before even being permitted to step aboard a spaceship and commence their training. Then, there is the two jazura waiting time for having your spaceship built.

In a press conference, she expressed her sorrow about the over-zealous and thoughtless territorial expansion of all the races and their disregard for the indigenous life on the newly settled planets in the Expansion Region. According to her Majesty, several species of plants have already been mutated or made extinct by the direct effects of massive colonisations and aggressive terraforming techniques, such as atmosphere scrubbing and landscape flooding.\n\nShe said, "It is with great concern that I address the noble leaders of the Argon, Teladi, Terran and Aldrian people. I've learned of the harm that our presence can bring to the wildlife of our new colonies, and I fear that if we all continue expansion at our current rates, countless species of animals and plants will be forever extinguished. The Boron are unwilling to continue with this reckless decimation of precious life, so we are calling for an agreement between our leaders to prevent the future extinction of other species before it is too late."\n\nThe exact date of the conference is still to be announced, but the participation of Split leading families is still very much in doubt.

Having now self-proclaimed themselves to be the saviours of all small and defenceless life forms in the universe, clearly these squids have caught a dose of Terran egomania.\n\nAldrian readers, do not be fooled by these altruistic gestures as their treacherous ways are well known to our officials, the Boron military is more than adept at designing weapons and ships with the sole purpose of killing humans.

It is almost guaranteed that our representatives will attend, but Boron eco-activists should not get their hopes up too soon. We have vast experience in eliminating potentially hazardous life forms and terraforming environments to suit ourselves, therefore we do not have any need to learn about other techniques the 'aquatics' may have designed and are offering to us. In any case, they would probably not be too relevant as our colonies are actually on dry land and not submerged ten metres below the surface of the seas.\n\nIn related news, the Aldrians have apparently ridiculed the influence of \033WQueen\033X \033WMenelaus\033X and the Kingdom of Boron in the Expansion Region.

Even though this is harsh and unjust treatment, citizens of the Commonwealth within Solara territory have very few legal rights and therefore it is highly unlikely that their criminal status will ever be revoked.

		<t id="2182">Earlier this wozura, an ancient Boron-owned mobile energy production ship of the 'Anastasius' class experienced a series of technical problems, ranging from a sudden shutdown of life support systems to the corruption of all navigational data. As the ship's operation was becoming increasingly unpredictable and there seemed a risk of a catastrophic failure, Teladi Captain \033WAdaraos\033X \033WPhantelesis\033X \033WMinanoras\033X \033WIV\033X set the autopilot to dock at the nearest shipyard as repairs would be less costly than purchasing and outfitting a new vessel. While the captain was asleep, and much to his surprise upon waking, due to yet another malfunction, the failing ship had mis-jumped right across the Solara system and was heading straight towards a docking port of an Argon shipyard.\n\nOn that particular tazura, the shipyard dock in question was already occupied by the semi-finished hull of an Argon Titan destroyer, one that was in no shape to move out of harm's way or suffer the least severity of impacts. The Argon Shipyard sent the standard warnings to the incoming ship, but when Navigation Officer \033WDaron\033X \033WBagger\033X finally received a response; he was shocked to learn that the approaching hulk was completely out of control and was on a direct collision course. When asked what emotions he experienced at the time, he replied: "It was utterly terrifying. From my observation screens it looked as if a huge wreck was floating ever so slowly towards our station. It seemed such a large piece of rickety old junk that I honestly expected the thing to explode at any moment and take our whole shipyard along with it." Luckily for him, the ship did not have any fuel left onboard, just tonnes of energy cells which the Teladi captain had not succeeded in selling to anyone. After an agonisingly slow 30 mizuras, during which the captain and his crew as well as all the construction workers around the Titan hull were evacuated to a safe distance, the two ships collided.\n\nThe immense momentum caused the near instant destruction of both ships, and all that remained from the fireball was some 3,000 individual energy cell crates floating about haphazardly in space. Captain \033WAdaraos\033X \033WPhantelesis\033X \033WMinanoras\033X \033WIV\033X reflects: "It was like a nightmare... all that profit gone to waste. You should have seen the swarm of freighters that raced to gather up as many crates as they could, they managed to eclipse the local system's sun for several mizuras! I know that our transporters are called 'Vultures', but I reckon that Argon traders may now be more deserving of that name."\n\nLuckily, the shipyard itself was not too damaged, the unfinished hull of the destroyer served as a physical shield between the mobile factory and the docking hub. All evidence of the accident has already been removed from the area, and the Teladi captain has bought himself a new ship from the compensation he received from the shipyard that had sold him the faulty 'Anastasius'. This time, Adaraos Phantelesis Minanoras IV has decided to play it safe and bought a 'Faunus' instead. And the reason? "What could possibly go wrong on a ship designed to produce high-yield missiles and weapons!"\n\nRoger Drewbon - Interstellar Broadcast Company</t>

		<t id="2192">Well-known among criminals and black market traders, the Paranid entrepreneur \033WKirinmanckelist\033X was arrested this tazura for sins against the Paranid Empire. One of his many ships, an old '\033WDarius\033X' class mobile tech factory, was found floating abandoned in the outer rim of \033WBenevolent\033X \033WSacrifice\033X by a lone Goner preacher who notified the Paranid police, thinking that it had been deserted by its owner. The police squad that arrived to investigate the ship found that the interior of the vessel had been completely re-engineered to accommodate a small microchip production line. In various storage compartments, hidden among the rotting remains of Argnu Beef, the police investigators discovered numerous containers of individually packaged slave chips. The production and use of slave chips has been banned by the Paranid for more than ten jazuras now, and this discovery of such a large illegal production facility is one of the best police finds of recent times. Instead of immediately destroying the ship, the police officers contacted their superiors and after receiving instructions to place small tracking beacons in each of the containers, they left the ship untouched.\n\nThe plan worked flawlessly and within two tazuras, all the containers had been shipped to other sectors by pirate smugglers. Shortly after the last container had been taken, Paranid frigates jumped directly to the various coordinates of the tracking beacons, and without giving warning or offering surrender terms, immediately opened fire at any pirate target in range. Within three stazuras, the Paranid had succeeded in destroying seven pirate bases and twelve pirate frigates throughout the whole Expansion Region.\n\nThe registered owner of the illegal factory, \033WKirinmanckelist\033X, claimed that he had no knowledge of his ship's location or modifications and that he was merely a victim of a conspiracy involving pirate clans and high-ranking priests within the Paranid government. Kirimanckelist is currently in custody and is being questioned in a secure location by the Paranid police. We are continuing to monitor any developments in this story.\n\nKetlamanckastrack - Imperial Paranid News</t>

		<t id="2202">The '\033WAmaranth\033X' mobile food factory owned by Teladi mogul, \033WInolamos\033X \033WPhantelesis\033X \033WTomulilis\033X \033WVII\033X, was confiscated last tazura on the grounds of being a potentially lethal health hazard.\n\nThe Argon police had received numerous reports claiming that an old and rusty mobile food factory had sold them Meatsteak Cahoonas which had liquefied due to old age. When police officials launched a secret investigation, by sending freighters manned by undercover agents to buy sample produce from all the mobile factories in Argon territory, they didn't really expect to discover anything. Much to their surprise however, in the fourth tazura of the investigation, one of their covert ships stopped transmitting its scheduled reports and disappeared. When police scouts finally located their missing transporter, it was floating in space and showed no major signs of life onboard. Once the police officers managed to open the hatch, it became clear what had happened; the Meatsteak Cahoona crates that were being transported onboard had ruptured and released extremely high concentrations of toxic gases, a common by-product in the decay of organic substances. The pilot and the police covert operative had both died in their sleep after choking to death.\n\nAfter taking samples of the gas, the liquefied Cahoonas and the containers, the police officers returned to their ship and flew back to base. Later the same tazura, a police corvette was dispatched to the abandoned freighter's location and completely incinerated it with a continuous plasma stream, burning every single piece of the debris to a crisp. The Argon Government is considering whether to sue \033WInolamos\033X \033WPhantelesis\033X \033WTomulilis\033X \033WVII\033X for bio-terrorism and suffocation with intent. If both of these charges hold, in addition to the 57 individual cases filed against him by other victims, Inolamos Phantelesis Tomulilis VII will face a prison sentence of up to 700 jazuras without the right of appeal or parole.\n\nNosilleas Polisomos Helicerisseas IX - Central Economy News</t>

		<t id="2211">Boron Panos accidentally mines a mine</t>
		<t id="2212">Three tazuras ago, a highly improbable and extremely tragic accident occurred in the \033WNew\033X \033WHorizons\033X sector. A state owned Boron '\033WPanos\033X' mobile mining ship, stationed itself directly next to an asteroid that was already being mined by an Argon mineral company. Before realising the terrible mistake they were making, the Boron ship started to mine the already hollowed out asteroid and killed 30 miners by accident. Investigators are still confused as to how this calamity could have happened.\n\nWe interviewed a specialist in mining and transportation techniques, \033WSimo\033X \033WNal\033X, and this is what he revealed to us: "Although highly improbable, this catastrophe can theoretically occur if several events coincide together. As we all know, mobile mining ships work on a different principle compared to that of regular fixed-location asteroid mines. Mobile mining ships generally do not use physical drills; they use a modified transport beam in conjunction with special chemicals that corrode the more porous sections of the ore seams. They first lock the transporter device onto a natural gas pocket within the asteroid and teleport as much chemical acid into it as they can manage. This essentially breaks up large sections within the asteroid, reducing the minerals inside to a manageable size that can be 'reverse' transported back into the cargo hold of the mobile factory."\n\n\033WSimo\033X \033WNal\033X concluded, "It appears that in this case, the captain of the ship somehow did not realise that the asteroid already had an ongoing mining operation in progress and hastily decided to fill up his cargo hold with ore on his way home. After coming to a full stop next to the rock, he ordered the onboard computer to lock onto the biggest gas pocket inside the asteroid, which in this case was tragically the main mining hub drilled deep within the asteroid. Due to malfunctioning security systems as well as an archaic communication relay that did not accept incoming transmissions without prior acknowledgement, he did not realise that he was pouring pure acid right on top of the Argon employees. It took him several mizuras to realise his mistake, by which time a large number of humans had been killed in an exceptionally painful way."\n\nSince this disaster appears to be due to an innocent mistake, the Argon Government will not bring criminal charges against the Kingdom of Boron, but the captain of the mining ship will however be tried for manslaughter next mazura. Experts claim that as it was in truth an accident and his ship was malfunctioning, his pleas for mercy will probably be listened to. Despite this, he may still face three life sentences in addition to 50 million credits in reparations.\n\nNorwen Gamblon - Interstellar Broadcast Company</t>

		<t id="2221">No more unlimited purchases from mobile factories, say Split</t>
		<t id="2222">Split weapon manufacturers are proposing to put forward new legislation to severely limit the weapon and missile production on mobile weapon production vessels such as the '\033WFaunus\033X' class ships. They claim that trigger happy combat pilots can too easily purchase all sorts of weapons from these factory-ship hybrids, and without being subject to any of the usual restrictions of race reputation that are imposed by regular weapon manufacturers. According to the research they have conducted in the last three jazuras, this has led to ever decreasing volumes of weapon sales at official outlets, and hence an equivalent decreasing yield of tax paid to the Split Government.\n\nIt is reported that so far the Argon and Boron representatives have agreed in principle with this new legislation, but the Paranid are suspicious and the Teladi government strongly disagrees. In order for the legislation to have any meaningful effect, it is crucial that all races must agree to enforce it in their respective territories. So far, the issue appears to be unresolved, as the Teladi see large profit losses if this new law is accepted, and the Paranid simply refuse to obey a commandment from any other lesser beings. The only proposal that has so far received total acceptance is that the mobile factory ships should be limited by whatever laws the race of its owner is obliged to follow. In effect though, this is a compromise which essentially does nothing to alleviate the problem.\n\nRtk t'Ltth - Split Clan News</t>

		<t id="2241">Mandatory regular ship examinations?</t>
		<t id="2242">With a myriad of incidents being blamed on the exceptionally poor maintenance of old ships, in particular refurbished mobile stations, the Commonwealth races have agreed to enforce new laws requiring a full safety assessment of every station and ship each jazura. Special agencies will be established to gather data on all actively flying ships and operational stations, whilst municipal authorities and commercial enterprises will be expected to comply with this new legislation.\n\nAs far as pilots themselves are concerned, opinions differ greatly, for instance a Boron mercenary told us: "The Boron believe that in the current circumstances it is for the best that these laws are enacted. We have seen a multitude of various ships on our travels that should never have left the dock at all due to their poor state of repair. The mobile factory ships are quite simply a bad joke... they are often seen missing support beams that snapped several jazuras ago or flying without whole sections of their outer hull. It is a miracle how they do not simply twist into a spiral just by going through a gate." But quite a different view however was expressed by a Teladi freelance trader: "We think that this is not a wise decision. Annual checkups will cost many credits from our pocket and greatly reduce our profitability. We believe that the pilot of each ship is always the one who knows his ship the best, and any official inspection team will be open to bribes to those who have the credits."\n\nAs you can see, opinions are poles apart. For now though, the laws will come into place starting next mazura, and cannot be amended for two jazuras, a kind of trial period to see how they turn out, and what advantages and disadvantages they bring.\n\nLulu Di - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

		<t id="2251">Jumping proven harmful to ship structures</t>
		<t id="2252">An unfortunate incident that occurred recently in Paranid space has possibly revealed yet another serious problem with existing jump drive technology. A Split \033WPanther\033X, owned by a Teladi trading mogul, was charging up its jump drive when a small micro-asteroid crashed into its main sensor array, causing a catastrophic navigational malfunction. The jump drive positioning systems, which rely on precise spatial coordinates in conjunction with temporal locks on the target gate, are exceptionally sensitive to navigational sensor data disruption. In this case, with the sudden complete absence of any navigation data, the jump drive went into an effectual lockdown and executed its primary default function - a random spatial jump. The frigate suddenly then found itself in the midst of an asteroid field in \033WNew\033X \033WHorizons\033X, with most of its structural integrity lost.\n\nIt seems that unplanned jumps can cause serious fluctuations in the hyperspace fabric that the entire jump gate system relies upon. Whilst the gates themselves seem to have been built with such incidents in mind, our ships have not, and so therefore the immense sub-atomic changes that occur upon such a jump, are fully capable of ripping an entire vessel apart. The captain of the Panther said that he was indeed lucky to have survived, with so many possible outcomes involving loss of life, to suffer only a structural backbone failure to his ship was one of the best results he could have hoped for. The frigate was towed to the nearest shipyard for major repairs, but this incident has opened up a new debate on the safety of using jump drives in civilian ships, as these are often modified and tend to lose certain tolerances over time due to stress on their structures from extended or extreme usage.\n\nTerracorp engineers have gathered on \033WArgon\033X \033WPrime\033X to discuss the issues raised and in order to prevent similar accidents occurring, they will attempt to modify the jump drive computer control algorithms to revert to a standby state instead of executing a default random jump. This fix is thought to be easily implementable in a software upgrade, but the earliest release date for such a patch is estimated to be not before the next fiscal quarter of the jazura.\n\nLesly James - Interstellar Broadcast Corporation</t>

		<t id="2261">Pirate attacks are getting more strategic</t>
		<t id="2262">Over the last few wozuras, pirate activity in our territory has increased markedly and their attacks seem to have become more organised and tactically proficient in nature. In a recent skirmish, four pirate heavy fighters and a corvette managed to single-handedly destroy an entire Terran patrol consisting of three frigates and an assortment of fighters, all manned with seasoned crew. The pirates appeared to be using entirely new tactics, previously only rumoured to be described in top secret military planning documents. The tactics that the pirates also used included such well-known manoeuvres as 'Rapid Enclosure', 'Dragonfist', 'Assisted Temporal Assault' and 'Hit It With A Stick', all of which have frequently been used by Commonwealth military strategists.\n\nTerran military command has launched a full internal investigation to check if there is a security breach in their strategic planning department. A recommendation for similar action has been issued to the other races as well, though it seems that the only response received so far went something like this: "We are fully appreciative of the level of concern you have shown to us, but we would kindly like to inform you that the \033WRoyal\033X \033WBoron\033X \033WStrategy\033X \033WDivision\033X has been operating for more than 100 jazuras with no known major leaks regarding military tactics. The Boron kindly suggest that you turn your esteemed attention to your own problems."\n\nNeedless to say, the other races have declined to comment at all so far, essentially making it impossible to know whether others leaked the information or not. Several people have inferred that all this may be proof of a deal between \033WAldrin\033X and the pirate clans, as the Aldrians have had full knowledge of this type of confidential information ever since the very first combined forces training exercise. Alternatively it could be possible that the pirates have finally acquired their own strategists.\n\nEmma Whi - Terran Morning News</t>

		<t id="2271">Split military tactician missing, presumed dead?</t>
		<t id="2272">Only in the last wozura have the Split military finally decided to release the news that their top planning strategist, \033WAdmiral\033X \033WChan\033X \033Wt'Phhg\033X, has been missing for more than a mazura, with no information as to his whereabouts. Several theories have been raised including kidnapping, extortion, assassination, unofficial exile, death in combat and abduction. As far as we know from the official briefing sessions, there have been no demands from kidnappers or suicide notes found.\n\nHowever, our Teladi contacts have discovered that one and a half mazuras ago, \033Y750\033X \033Ymillion\033X credits were transferred to the Admiral's bank account and the money then vanished very quickly; the official reason for this strange transaction has been described as an accountancy error. This does however raise suspicion in the minds of many analysts and some even say that the Admiral might have been 'encouraged' to join certain illegal pirate fleets. An assumption bolstered by both the mysterious transaction and the fact that over the last mazura, pirate attacks have evolved strategically, showing signs of a new tactical command capability. As the Admiral had no close relations with anyone and no known official life beyond his military duties, there is no one more matching the profile of a 'mole', with access to sell highly secret tactical information, than him. A Split military spokesman has stated however that such rumours are laughable, but he did indicate that the Admiral has recently has been stripped of his military rank, privileges and security clearance on the grounds of not being in an acceptable state for duty - a serious allegation for any Split warrior.\n\nWarren Brass - Interstellar Broadcast Corporation</t>

		<t id="2281">Weapons for children?</t>
		<t id="2282">A rather worrying incident occurred just last wozura at an orphanage located in \033WKingdom\033X \033WEnd\033X. In a recent act of charity, the Boron Royal Family organised several shipments of much needed food rations and basic educational material to be sent to several orphanages throughout the Kingdom of Boron. It did not however all go as planned, there were several minor delays and mistakes with the amounts of aid, but none of these problems can be compared with the massive blunder made by the \033WRoyal\033X \033WInterplanetary\033X \033WMail\033X.\n\nThe headmaster of the 'Good Flow Orphanage' in \033WKingdom\033X \033WEnd\033X was surprised to find that all of the charity shipments he received contained no food or toys, but military grade firearms and anti-personnel fragmentation grenades. At the time, the headmaster immediately pointed out to the courier that a slip-up had occurred, but this was a waste of effort as the courier refused to listen and claimed that no mistake had been made. In fact the courier went on to explain that "early education, involving armament training, would produce highly expert recruits for the military in the future... an admirable goal which surpassed all others!"\n\nDespite the rather surreal circumstances of the incident, the headmaster now says that this accidental shipment of 40 tonnes of military weaponry has been the best possible gift to the orphanage. He admitted that he'd sold the brand new weapons to several legally recognised Boron militias and mercenary factions, earning more than enough to provide a decent education for all the children in the orphanage. Although the Royal Interplanetary Mail has now admitted that they indeed made an error, they would take no action against the orphanage, as it was clearly not their fault and their actions appeared quite reasonable and legal.\n\nLolo Pi - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

		<t id="2291">Smart missiles in development</t>
		<t id="2292">The last few decazuras have shown that while weapon technology has advanced greatly, missile guidance systems have not evolved at all. The majority are still limited by primitive prediction algorithms, static flight paths or simply poor design, all resulting in challenging and hasty decision making when using them in skirmishes and other hostile situations. All this however can soon be expected to change, Boron and Argon scientists have finally revealed their first biotic missile guidance prototypes.\n\nInstead of hard-wired processors and relays, the new guidance systems use live neural cells in conjunction with electronic data storage devices. This has resulted in a symbiotic, semi-organic device that can process complex tasks up to 30 times faster than conventional systems, and adapt to different targeting priorities nearly instantaneously. The scientists say that this is a major breakthrough in missile technology and should increase the effectiveness of missiles tenfold while only doubling the production price. Certain anti-Xenon activists, famous for protesting against all developments in artificially intelligent weapon systems, have already stated that it is far too dangerous to have missiles with living brains. The lead developer \033WMoko\033X \033WNi\033X, however explained that these devices have no potential to achieve sentience, independent decision making or evolution of higher thought processes, and thus he hoped that any concerns of a new Xenon like threat emerging would be put to rest.\n\nCurrently the new missile systems are being thoroughly tested for defects and abnormal behaviour and only one potentially serious flaw has so far been discovered, all the new systems have an exceptionally short lifespan. As the living cells produce a large amount of bio-waste material and there is no inherent removal system present within the prototype missile types, the biotic brain is fatally poisoned by its own toxic by-products within a few wozuras. Despite this setback however, the scientists maintain that this new weapon technology has great promise and will probably come to dominate the next generation of disposable weapons.\n\nNini Gu - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

		<t id="2301">Boron Ion weaponry a mistake?</t>
		<t id="2302">Recent market analysis by Boron weapon specialists has revealed a disturbing fact concerning the current focus of all Boron weapon research and development agencies. Boron Ion weapons, especially the newest types, appear too expensive to produce in large quantities. Chief Analyst \033WMila\033X \033WGo\033X explains: "The Boron Government was quite astonished to see the results of our extensive market research. It turns out that our pride and joy, the Ion weapon family, is extremely expensive to produce in the quantities required by the Boron military. Due to the unsafe working conditions and highly sensitive technologies involved, Ion weapon forges are forced to spend up to 20% more in credits per unit than any other equivalent weapon type. In short, this means that manufacturing these new weapons is much more damaging to our economy than we Boron had first anticipated." He also stated that a complete re-assessment of all armament manufacturing should now be made to minimise any future economic impact.\n\nEarly suggestions include reductions in production quality affecting combat performance and weapon life expectancy, or even using cheap 'foreign' labour. All these factors however, ironically make the Ion weapons currently preferable over their counterparts from the other races. Other weapon experts have yet to respond to this surprising news, but it is known that a large number of Royal Academy specialists have suddenly diverted their attention to the interplanetary weapons market, quite possibly in hopes of refuting the hypothesis that Ion weapon technology is not commercially viable.\n\nAsnamanckasaalt - Imperial Paranid News</t>

		<t id="2311">Pilot tries Boron drugs, dies shortly afterwards</t>
		<t id="2312">The patrol leader of a fighter squadron in the USC scout forces died last wozura due to his misuse of Boron drugs. Hoping to learn more of the Boron culture and their customs, the USC patrol leader injected himself with an illegally obtained drug that is favoured by the Boron as a weak relaxant. Unaware that the Boron only add this drug as a minor additive to their water environment suits, the pilot had clearly not done his homework and paid the ultimate price when he injected the drug concentrate directly into his veins with a medicinal syringe. While the Boron are accustomed to weak solutions of this drug and therefore think of it as "safe", the pilot had in reality absorbed such a huge amount of the substance that it could of put five Terran elephants to sleep.\n\nThe friends of the poor pilot instantly alerted the nearest medical facility, and the 'druggie' was rushed to a hospital within ten mizuras. Much to the doctor's surprise, the pilot was still alive, though barely, but was completely unaware of his surroundings or in control of his bodily functions. Over the following 15 mizuras, while the doctors fought for his life, the pilot mumbled, kicked, cited ancient poetry and even tried to talk in binary, though apparently without much success. Despite the continued efforts of the hospital staff, the pilot did not survive his own 'immersion' in Boron culture. It is unknown where he obtained the drugs, but the USC military authorities have promised to ensure that there are no more intoxicated pilots who are potentially endangering their comrades by flying 'high'.\n\nEmma Whi - Terran Morning News</t>

		<t id="2321">Entire ship classes useless, say Split</t>
		<t id="2322">The renowned Split military advisor of the \033WFamily\033X \033WRhonkar\033X has reportedly claimed that the present trend of expanding ship class types and the creation of newer and newer frigates, corvettes and carriers, is a foolish idea that the Split should abandon as soon as possible. According to him, the actual effectiveness of corvettes and frigate class ships in battle scenarios is rather poor and clearly inferior to the combat prowess of the basic destroyer. He says that deploying several frigates instead of a single destroyer is detrimental to the effectiveness of a fleet. A single destroyer, whilst financially worth as much as two frigates, can easily outperform seven frigates in most military situations, making it an operationally superior vessel. Frigates seem in reality unable to properly fulfil their purpose whether as support for heavier ships or as individual combat vessels. They cannot stand as the main brunt of the assault force, and cannot deliver effective supporting fire to outweigh the increased resources and manpower they consume. Corvettes, commonly known as the 'M6' class, are therefore completely redundant, says the advisor. The 'Dragon Incident' was a good warning of what is in store for these ships, and the situation has not improved one bit since then. Corvettes are easily outperformed both by heavier fighters and destroyers in a multitude of situations, and one corvette cannot achieve anything without proper fighter support.\n\nWhile these are sentiments many share, the advisor went on even further and announced that in his opinion, even carriers, which have historically served as the backbone of all fleets, are also probably redundant and that a good destroyer with flak weaponry can easily outclass a carrier with its entire garrison of fighter craft for far less expense and with a smaller crew. Whilst these claims were all made when the advisor was allegedly inebriated and carry no official weight, the head of military forces for the Family Rhonkar is said to be considering his dismissal and has already begun to seek a replacement for him.\n\nLenmanckastraat - Imperial Paranid News</t>

		<t id="2331">Aldrians try to drown a Boron Kraken!</t>
		<t id="2332">As if further to highlight the ignorance of the Aldrians and the fundamental differences between alien technology and their own, an amusing incident has come to our attention involving a small group of Aldrian isolationists trying unsuccessfully to destroy a Boron ship.\n\nA recently refurbished Boron \033WKraken\033X class missile frigate, the '\033WFreeflow\033X', was passing through Solara space when an engine containment unit ruptured forcing it to dock at a local shipyard. Apparently as chance would have it, three members of an infamous radical Aldrian isolationist faction also docked at the shipyard shortly afterwards, right next to the '\033WFreeflow\033X'. Since they had not seen a Boron ship up close before, or even heard of the semi-organic hulls used in Boron space technology, they assumed that the entire ship was a massive alien entity intent on devouring the station. They hastily devised a rash and foolish plan to get rid of the assumed invader and attempted to kill it by injecting massive amounts of neural disruptor liquid into the alien "body". Their efforts to damage the ship went unnoticed for the better part of a tazura but the extremists were finally caught when the increased surface humidity, caused by their liquid injections, finally triggered environmental sensors built within the ship's control systems. Local police officers quickly apprehended the offenders, and no real harm was inflicted on the Boron ship, as the \033WKraken\033X does not in any case contain actual live cells in its hull. Though Boron ships are organic, they are only living whilst undergoing construction, a finished ship is no more alive than common iron ore.\n\nEmma Whi - Terran Morning News</t>

		<t id="2342">In a startling turn of events, a perfectly ordinary Boron ship docked at a Aldrian spaceport on \033WAldrin\033X, and then accidentally caused one of the greatest sector lockdowns in the history of Spaceport 5. Shortly after the Boron heavy fighter docked, automatic bio-hazard detection alarms went off throughout the entire station, causing it to be hermetically sealed moments later as part of the automated failsafe procedures. A large team of specialists arrived on the scene within a stazura, but found nothing life-threatening; all the people that had been trapped inside the station were still very much alive, and initial environmental scans showed no evidence of any contamination.\n\nAfter a much more thorough investigation, Solara Security has determined that the cause of this false alarm was the Boron \033WBarracuda\033X fighter itself. As the ship had passed through a system earlier, it had endured a brief, yet powerful exposure to solar radiation. While all vessels are heavily shielded against random bursts of radiation, this particular craft had a malfunctioning shield resonator, making it more vulnerable to radiation of certain types. When the ship landed, a small section of its outer hull had already begun to evaporate, releasing large amounts of microscopic organic particles into the ventilation system, which in turn were picked up by the automated sensor system and interpreted as the charred remains of a mutated living organism. The ship has now been repaired and compensation paid to the employees of Spaceport 5 who were forced to spend nearly two tazuras quarantined in total isolation.\n\nKaren Styles - Solara News Network</t>

		<t id="2351">Financially troubled shipyards release new corvette</t>
		<t id="2352">Over the last two mazuras, the expansion into the new territories has resulted in a major financial loss for the Terran Treasury. Already in debt, due to the massive production costs incurred from building new capital ships such as the recently upgraded '\033WValhalla\033X', the shipyards have been the main victims of the economic crisis that struck shortly after the re-discovery of \033WSolara\033X. Although things were looking grim for all the Terran ship builders, it seems that tough times have bred tough minds, and a brand new corvette design, created less than three mazuras ago, has now entered full production.\n\nNamed the '\033WShamshir\033X', this new craft is a complete departure from all existing USC ship designs and it will be available to both civilian and corporate clients. With a redesigned interior layout and repositioned turrets, the Shamshir is a worthy successor to the infamous '\033WKatana\033X', which proved itself to be the least popular choice among corvette users back in the Commonwealth. As lead designer \033WLloyd\033X \033WFarthing\033X recently told us during a press debriefing, the Shamshir has an improved streamlined design, a reinforced hull, superior combat capabilities, enhanced targeting systems, and crew quarters nearly twice as spacious compared to that of the Katana. This new corvette is positioned commercially to fulfil the role of a fleet support vessel or as a squadron level command ship.\n\nIt would not be an understatement to say that the future of the Terran shipbuilding industry depends upon the commercial success of the Shamshir. With crippling debts and financial commitments to numerous companies, only a commercially successful line of inspiring new ships can save the Terran shipbuilders in the long run. So far, it seems that the very first new ship off the line, the Shamshir, should not fail to deliver.\n\nEmma Whi - Terran Morning News</t>

		<t id="2362">For several mazuras now, various scouts and "freelance" photographers have excitedly been releasing long distance fuzzy shots of a very large Split vessel. Only ever sighted in a number of Split border sectors and always far from the usual trade lanes, this has led to a rise in rumours that the Split have spent the best part of the last jazura creating a destroyer that could match the flagships of the other races, such as the renowned Paranid '\033WOlympos\033X' and Argon '\033WLeviathan\033X'. Three wozuras ago, the veil of secrecy was finally lifted when the Split military went public and revealed their latest battleship, called the '\033WTaipan\033X'. While still maintaining the signature razor-sharp sleekness that all the latest generation Split capital ships possess, the Taipan is significantly larger and more hard-hitting than even the deadly '\033WPython\033X' class.\n\nThe official unveiling ceremony was very Split-like, but with an interesting twist. The Split military had invited a group of Boron journalists and photographers to participate in this "momentous event", and suggested to them that they arrive in their own ships and join the other representatives at specific coordinates. All the other invited observers were sent the same message, but with different coordinates for reasons then unknown. Once the ships had amassed, the Split announced over the general communications channel that "this is it," and a newly commissioned Taipan jumped right into the sector perfectly on time.\n\nThe Split had conspired to hide a jump beacon amongst the invited Boron ships, and their plan had been that their new destroyer would crush them by jumping into the same physical area of space they were occupying. Luckily the plan failed as the tagged Boron transporter in question had suffered a minor engine malfunction which had prevented it from arriving on time. Despite this incident, labelled an assassination attempt by the Boron, the actual unveiling was extremely well planned and most certainly got the right message across to the other Commonwealth races.\n\nWith this impressive demonstration of military power, the Split have effectively announced to all other races that they now have the ways and means to defend their territory with an unprecedented ability. Whether this was all just a public relations stunt or the Split really do have bigger plans now, remains to be seen. In any case, the Taipan is now ready for mass production, and the first models are already being commissioned for use by the Split military.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2372">Teladi ships have always suffered a certain reputation for being both inelegant and inferior, this in part has been down to second-rate marketing, but it's more due to the questionable build quality and lacklustre combat performance. According to Teladi ship designers however, all these criticisms will now be a thing of the past. The gigantic '\033WPhoenix\033X' class destroyer, known to have caused several calamities solely due to its sheer size, has been updated and refitted to meet the highest expectations of military admirals and is now capable of serving as a true flagship.\n\nThe '\033WPhoenix\033X \033WMk\033X \033WII\033X' has better engines, superior power generators, additional armour in vital areas and re-modelled turret positions for more efficient target tracking. The entire internal structure has been reworked from scratch, so the ship is now thought to be at least twice as resilient to physical impacts and any subspace turbulence encountered whilst traversing jump gates. The Mk II is rapidly earning the reputation of being one of the best destroyers currently in service and preliminary combat performance assessments indicate it is far superior to its predecessor. Unsurprisingly the purchase price for the Phoenix Mk II has increased significantly.\n\nDue to the success of this new vessel, the old Phoenix model has recently been retired, and a brand new ship has been designed and produced to fulfil the now vacant role of light destroyer. Intended for smaller task force groups requiring good manoeuvrability to provide a quick response, the '\033WEmeus\033X' has been acknowledged as a worthy replacement for the old Phoenix. The Emeus is loosely based on the original Phoenix design, but the new model is leaner and the old structure has been stripped down leading to a much more compact form, but with a reduction in cargo bay capacity and crew quarters. The combat performance of this new light destroyer has been judged by independent military analysts as slightly above average, a great score considering that the Emeus has to compete with not only other light destroyers, but also heavy destroyers as well, such as the '\033WOlympos\033X' and the new Phoenix Mk II.\n\nThe Emeus is destined to take part in border defence and rapid response fleets, with the Phoenix Mk II serving as the real grunt of the Teladi military, and reserved for vital sector patrols and coordinated massive attacks.\n\nNegosillis Seolassis Yosikallis XI - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2381">Technological marvels : Amaranth</t>
		<t id="2382">The second ship to be completed in the mobile factory range, the '\033WAmaranth\033X' is a mobile hydroponics station that was designed and built less than ten jazuras ago by a genius Teladi entrepreneur. It was originally intended to act as an emergency production facility in the case of a catastrophic event, or critical loss of food manufacturing capability within a border region. The real value of this ship has only just been realised; by using these vessels to provide their fleets with fresh food rations, the Teladi have gained a great advantage during the colonisation of the Expansion Region. Avoiding the usual large expenditure on food production and logistics, the Amaranth gives them the ability to send out an additional 20% of settlers per colonial fleet.\n\nThe core concept of the Amaranth is identical to all other mobile factories and is nothing more than several standard bio-domes connected together in a row, with engines and a bridge attached at opposite ends. The bio-domes have had to undergo significant modifications in order to be able to withstand the extreme stresses endured in crossing jump gate event horizons. Even with these improvements, the mobile factory is a fragile thing, constantly under threat of breaking apart due to structural stresses greatly exceeding that of a normal spaceship. Each dome of an Amaranth is a self-contained bio-sphere, capable of varying its internal climate to accommodate all known bio-substances used by the Commonwealth races. All the energy from the ship's reactor is used to power the shields and engines, therefore any energy or other crucial resources used for production processes have to be externally supplied.\n\nCurrently there is no requirement for a special production license to operate this ship for commercial purposes, and a number of businessmen have bought an Amaranth for themselves. One can't help but sit back and admire them, plodding through the trade lanes like lumbering beasts, trading their produce for credits and energy.\n\nLee Rayne - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2391">Technological marvels : Panos</t>
		<t id="2392">The '\033WPanos\033X' mobile ore smelting ship was the first mobile factory ever built. The initial objective was to reduce the cost of building mines on low-yield silicon asteroids that contained significant amounts of precious silicate, yet were unlikely to provide a large enough output to justify a permanent mine. The Panos relies on Goner transporter technology for its successful operation and uses a large modified transporter module coupled with a highly sensitive scanner that is capable of pinpointing microscopic cavities within an asteroid. Once a sufficiently deep cavity has been located, the Panos uses its transporter device to beam highly acidic chemicals inside the asteroid to weaken its cohesiveness and corrode it away from within. After that, the scanner then locates any ore pieces that have been freed from the surrounding material, and they are transported directly into the ship's smelting bay for processing.\n\nSince the technology is rather rudimentary in its basic operation, every Panos can refine all of the known minerals found in space, including the rare Nividium. Currently the Panos is the most widely-used mobile factory model, and there is a good chance that you may often see one wherever large clusters of small-yield asteroids are abundant.\n\nLee Rayne - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2401">Technological marvels : Anastasius</t>
		<t id="2402">The '\033WAnastasius\033X' is a ship that should not really even exist. It is in reality a mobile Solar Power Plant, but it uses a somewhat revolutionary technique to accumulate energy in storage cells compared to its stationary counterpart. Although methods of solar energy accumulation can vary greatly, the only common feature between a Solar Power Plant and an Anastasius is that they both use solar energy collectors and energy cells.\n\nIn ordinary solar power plants, extremely large quantities of raw crystals are used as disposable conductor chains which direct the solar energy into energy cell clusters, separating radioactive energy and light in the process. The Anastasius, however, is capable of functioning without any crystals as it uses its central power generator as the conductor. The ship's specially modified power generator is capable of converting small flows of energy into a form that can be stored within an energy cell, and this processes the output from the collector dish using a dense network of optical cables. Whilst at first glance this may seem like a source of unlimited free energy, the heavy toll of the energy conversion process wears out the ship's power reactor at an extremely fast rate, often rendering them useless within four jazuras. Replacing these reactors is an expensive undertaking, complicated by both their complexity and close integration with the ship's other systems. In a bid to improve their profitability, the latest versions of the Anastasius class are able to use small amounts of crystals to double their production rate without a noticeable reduction in generator lifespan.\n\nRight now, a number of these ships are being used as mobile power stations within sectors that are experiencing severe energy shortages due to various problems. While the Anastasius is not the most lucrative of all mobile factories, it has proven to be among the most useful in all colonisation fleets.\n\nLee Rayne - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2411">Technological marvels : Darius</t>
		<t id="2412">The '\033WDarius\033X' class mobile factories have seen many major changes in their comparatively short history. At the time of their creation, the first Darius prototypes were intended to solely produce crystals in a bid to improve the energy supply problems that often plagued the Commonwealth sectors. It was soon discovered however that the crystals made by Darius were slightly sub-standard and the ship was removed from sale shortly afterwards. Eventually, the designers found a way to overcome this issue by using newer and more expensive replication technologies for production processes, resulting in the re-launch of the Darius class.\n\nThe second and current iteration of the Darius, whilst using the same hull and framework as the original model, is able to produce most major specialist products; it is no longer simply a mobile crystal factory, but a mobile hi-tech complex. This major improvement has unfortunately come at a price, and for the crew of the Darius vessel, it is often paid in blood. The working conditions aboard a Darius are marginally worse than what slaves experience in Split mining colonies, and the mortality rate amongst employees is extremely high. This regrettable downside has meant that Darius class vessels are normally only used by government backed entrepreneurs and wealthy commercial moguls with connections to the murkier side of the universe, ensuring their safety by various means from embittered employee relatives and creditors. Ethical problems aside though, the Darius is still a worthy investment, especially if run in full automated production mode.\n\nLee Rayne - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2421">Technological marvels : Faunus</t>
		<t id="2422">The '\033WFaunus\033X' is probably the most controversial ship ever built. It is a mobile weapons forge, and as long as it has been provided a weapon pattern template beforehand, it is technically capable of producing any armament. Even before the first Faunus was launched, the Split, Paranid and Boron Weapon Manufacturer Guilds appealed to the Teladi asking them to block the production of the Faunus, claiming it would severely damage the profitability of their own weapons factories. The Teladi however refused, seeing the Faunus as yet another way of making massive profits.\n\nShortly after the inaugural launches, the weapon manufacturers of various stations asked for special licenses covering every possible weapon that could be manufactured on a Faunus. Their requests were provisionally accepted for a brief period of time, but they quickly ran into problems when various governments began to question whether these weapon station owners should not be held accountable under the same special licensing restrictions as the Faunus owners themselves. All existing trading agreements and investment plans were immediately withdrawn, and since that time, beyond actually acquiring a weapon that has to be produced, the owner of a Faunus has but one obligation to the authorities. As a precaution, all weapons manufactured on a Faunus have the serial number of the ship imprinted on them, thereby making it impossible for a Faunus captain to openly trade these weapons with criminals and pirates. Even then, some of the more exotic weapons are still not available for replication due to embedded system fail safes, these immediately stop manufacturing a device if it is not completely compatible with the ship's own technology.\n\nIn these tazuras, the Faunus can be seen in both the Commonwealth and the Expansion Region sectors, travelling through the gates and trading many types of armaments. Most of these ships are heavily protected, as their valuable cargo often makes them prime targets for most pirate factions.\n\nLee Rayne - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2432">A possibly unique project has just been commenced back on \033WArgon\033X \033WPrime\033X. A special fleet consisting of a carrier with its full complement of fighters, ten mobile factories and several civilian frigates have embarked upon a journey in the hope of finding new and habitable worlds among the distant stars far away from known space. They will carry with them a special locator beacon that once set, will allow jump drives to lock on to its signature and enable ships here to join up with this distant fleet. The beacon will not be activated before the destination is reached, and the mobile factories tagging along will provide food, energy, raw materials and equipment to the fleet.\n\nThis exciting mission began a wozura ago, when the expeditionary fleet simultaneously executed a joint emergency 'unfocused' jump to random coordinates, this being a basic feature of every jump drive that renders the destination coordinates untraceable afterwards. Since the current location, direction and status of the expeditionary fleet is unknown, no contact is possible and until the beacon is finally dropped, there is no possibility of any communication between them and the Commonwealth. The fleet is manned only by Argon and Boron crew; the Terrans were not invited to join, the Split were deemed too aggressive for such a mission, and the Paranid refused to be isolated with lesser lowerlifes for such a long time. The total number of volunteers that were accepted for the mission was 60,000 by the latest estimate; it is expected to be interesting and enlightening to see how they have survived and prospered once their mission is over.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2441">Aldrians accept Zuran time legislation</t>
		<t id="2442">Ever since the so-called "rediscovery" of the \033WSolara\033X system, the Terrans and the other Commonwealth alien races have continuously attempted to eradicate every part of Aldrian cultural identity. One of the recurring themes in debates over the way the people of Solara live their lives has been the alien obsession with having a unified time reference system. "Aldrians have been using modified \033WGalactic\033X \033WStandard\033X \033WTime\033X, or GST, for more than half a millennia now. The planet Earth was lost to us, so we adapted the ancient years, months, days and hours to reflect the rotational characteristics of Aldrin, as there seemed no logic in sticking to the old ways," said an Aldrian historian.\n\nHowever, the races of the so-called Commonwealth are now pressurising our politicians to move to their arcane and ridiculous universal '\033WZuran\033X' time measurement system. From what little there is to know, Zuran time was created by the imperialistic mutant lizards who call themselves the 'Teladi', and this Zuran time simply reflects the day/night cycle of their swamps on their home world. The Terrans inexplicably converted to this Teladi system only a few weeks ago, or wozuras ago, as everyone will now be obliged to say, and since then the combined diplomatic and economic pressure from the other races has made it increasingly inevitable that we will have to conform likewise.\n\nToday, or should I say this tazura, the Government of \033WAldrin\033X and the Colonies of Solara have agreed to make Zuran time the official time reference system, relegating GST to a simple curiosity of a bygone age. According to Aldrian spokesman, \033WYakamoto\033X \033WNigushira\033X, "the introduction of Zuran time marks the beginning of a new era, a time where our traditional ways will no longer suffice. The move to Zuran time is as much a symbolic gesture as it is a political one, showing to the other races that we Aldrians are able to adapt just as well, if not better, than others."\n\nFrom now on, Aldrians will have to use sezuras instead of seconds, mizuras for minutes, stazuras for hours, tazuras for days, wozuras for weeks, mazuras for months and jazuras instead of years.\n\nKaren Styles - Solara News Network</t>

		<t id="2451">Zuran time adopted by all Terran Expansion Region colonies</t>
		<t id="2452">"Ever since we originally joined our Solar System to the network of jump gates and discovered the existence of the other alien races of the Commonwealth, we have repeatedly been asked to adopt their time system, known as '\033WZuran\033X' time," said the Terran renowned historian \033WWilson\033X \033WSmith\033X. "Initially, their request made little sense, as the time measurement system used on \033WEarth\033X and beyond had served us well for nearly 3,000 years. Now, with the rediscovery of the long lost colony of \033WAldrin\033X, and the creation of several new colonies in the Expansion Region, there seems little sense in adhering to the old Earth time, especially now that we have all been completely cut off from the Solar System."\n\nThe move to '\033WZuran\033X' time has been greeted with mixed feelings within the Terran colonies, initially there were a lot of protests, but then gradually more and more people acknowledged that the move to Zuran time was not to be taken as a loss of something precious, but rather as a recognition of a new reality. As some people are still coming to terms with the intricacies of the Zuran system, here is a simplified translation for them: years are now called jazuras, months are mazuras, weeks are wozuras, days are tazuras, hours are known as stazuras, minutes are mizuras and seconds are known as sezuras. While the actual length of each new unit of time is quite different compared to our old system, conversions are made automatically by all electronic interfaces whenever necessary, so there really is no need to remember the mathematics behind 'Zuran' time.\n\nWith yet another unnecessary complication in trading negotiations now being removed, experts claim that the change to Zuran time will further enhance the Terran relations with the Commonwealth races and open up a wealth of new trade possibilities. In fact, the latest figures from raw material commodity markets show that Terran-Commonwealth trade deals have grown by as much as 7% over just the last two mazuras. Yet another of the many predicted positive effects from this beneficial change also showed itself recently, the Solara government has reluctantly also agreed to adopt 'Zuran' time, replacing their confusing and irrelevant GST system.\n\nEmma Whi - Terran Morning News</t>

		<t id="2461">Traders complain about new sector layouts</t>
		<t id="2462">Several merchant groups, well known for their successful operations in the Commonwealth, have told us in recent press briefings that they are extremely disappointed with the new sector colonisation strategies, and the relative lack of coordination between industrial complexes and their supply bases. According to one spokesman, \033WChu\033X \033Wt'Nhhk\033X, the main complaints about trading in the Commonwealth were often attributed to "the inconsistent and seemingly random location of space stations combined with the lack of any real planning leading to wasteful travelling times, plus the erratic positioning of station docking hubs increasing the risk of collisions whilst giving some rival traders an unfair advantage." As he pointed out, "it appears that the new sectors of the Expansion Region are suffering exactly the same fate as before, as all the various governments seemed not to have learned from their past mistakes. Once again they are permitting everyone to just plonk their space stations wherever they desire, without any regard to efficient commercial operations."\n\nMarket analysts from a major Teladi profit consulting company decided to take these complaints and test their validity. First, the Teladi researchers went to the esteemed Boron path-finding analyst \033WMoko\033X \033WNi\033X, to see whether he had any comment on the alleged lack of organisation of station placements within the Boron colonies. "Your sources are not entirely accurate," said Moko Ni. "The Boron have planned for every station to be where it should be, and all our installations have been created with considerable thought as to the present and future state of the universe's commercial markets. We have prepared for every eventuality... in the big picture; everything is exactly where it should be."\n\nFollowing this, the analysts went to see the renowned Split Chief Executive of Station Setup and Positioning Planning, \033WGal\033X \033Wt'Dhhr\033X. He refused however to give a proper interview when requested, due to having, quote: "problems with a steel-legged table after a gnawing attack." He did find time later however to tell them that the Split have often planned and co-ordinated their station locations with the Teladi government to ensure maximum efficiency when it comes to both the economy and trade lanes.\n\nAs two leading experts had now clearly contradicted the original complaints, the investigation team decided to report back on the validity of the traders criticisms. After contacting their offices back in the Commonwealth, the team has discovered that the 'merchants' in question have had a long history of abusing various lucrative trade markets, indulging in illegal trade practices, as well as frequently sabotaging any trading competition to them and hiring mercenaries to take them out. So it does appear that they have once again tried to play their usual trick of being dishonest and slandering good, honest people purely for their own ends.\n\nNaopsis Losillegas Nagisis IV - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2471">Petition submitted forbidding individual ship names</t>
		<t id="2472">In the last mazura, a petition forbidding ship owners to officially rename their ships was handed to the Boron, Argon and Paranid Governments for approval. The reason stated for this unusual request is that the police claim it is extremely difficult to identify the make and model of a ship if it is called "\033WThe\033X \033WTartan\033X \033WTorpedo\033X" instead of "\033WBoron\033X \033WMako\033X".\n\nThe petition has been backed by a very large number of police and military authorities, but it has also received wide-spread criticism from both individual traders and civilians that frequent space. The objectors claim that the ability of a captain to choose a personalised name for their ship is a fundamental right and it is not something that should be outlawed for such a petty reason. According to them, most military pilots are embittered because they cannot name their ships outside of the limited options laid down by military protocol, and hence are jealous for that reason alone.\n\nEvery ship has its own unique identification code that reflects the owner's allegiance as well as the ship's class and release number, all of which should be more than enough to tell an observer what it actually is, and there should be no need to further identify a ship by forcing it to have a fixed name. Since a large number of civilians however continue to name their ships either on a personal whim or to facilitate various data monitoring facilities, it is expected that the petition will not gain support within the government. The petition may in any case be in violation of several universally accepted statutes of individual freedoms, so it seems you will still be able to see such stirring and evocative ship names like "\033WPink\033X \033WTaipan\033X", "\033WThe\033X \033WPoochie\033X \033WObliterator\033X", "\033WFish'n\033X \033WChips\033X" and "\033WHello\033X \033WKitty\033X \033WFalcon\033X", that help lighten up those tedious and boring journeys between the sectors.\n\nAnne Rice - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2482">It is no secret that the Split, by their very nature, are extremely aggressive. They value weapons, offensive capabilities and firepower above everything else and the only thing a Split warrior loves to do more than bragging about his weaponry, is to use it all in a gunfight. For this reason, the bars favoured by the Split have long been classed as some of the most dangerous places in the galaxy for any non-Split being or object. Well, it now seems that the threat rating has gone sky-high after the \033WSplit\033X \033WArms\033X \033WResearch\033X \033Wand\033X \033WDevelopment\033X \033WInstitute\033X officially unveiled their latest recent creation. The new weapon is a modified \033WPhoton\033X \033WPulse\033X \033WCannon\033X which has been stripped, miniaturised, fitted with special handles, support wheels and manual triggers which have allowed it to be, astonishingly, classified as a hand weapon.\n\nThough it is legally considered to be the same as a regular pulse rifle, in reality this weapon is nothing less than a monstrous combination of technologies, with wires, crystals and a fair bit of luck keeping it from falling apart. It is twice as wide, four times as long, and stands almost a third higher than your average Split and weighs in at just over 300 kilograms. It features three support wheels to keep it from crushing its owner, a ridiculously oversized and unnecessary targeting scope which is not actually reachable unless you choose to climb on top of the weapon, and all the firepower and destructive capabilities that its larger ship mounted counterpart possesses. It is currently priced at ten times the price of a normal ship PPC, and there is already a four mazura waiting list in order to obtain the weapon as it has already been acknowledged to be the most enviable weapon of choice in death match battles.\n\nEvery Split is obliged to have extensive training in the use of heavy weapons, which in reality is nothing more than a mere formality, as all Split pass this course the moment they come of age and are given possession of a rifle. The blueprints for this weapon have now been sent by special courier to the Institute branch operating in the Expansion Region, so regardless of whether you live in the Commonwealth or Solara, you now have even more reason to hide when you see a small Split struggling with a very, very large gun.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2491">Split give new meaning to the term 'Race to the Death'</t>
		<t id="2492">Station-skipping is a well known illegal sport, and it is extremely popular among taxi drivers and other pilots. The basics are quite simple; anything between three to thirty ships arrive at the designated race start point where they then receive the data containing the nominated stations, the winner is then ship that visits all the checkpoints in the fastest time possible. There are very few rules governing the race apart from a ban on using capital ships, blowing up the stations and bribing the judges. Everything else is considered fair game, including sabotage, kidnapping and even injuring your opponents along with any hapless bystanders. Even as dangerous as it now, the Split were not content with such a gentle sport, and came up with their own variation called "\033WThe\033X \033WRace\033X".\n\nThe Split version has quite a lot more rules, but they do not in any way reduce the level of danger within the competition itself. For example, one of the rules explicitly states that you lose points for every opportunity missed to destroy your opponent. "The Race" takes place in regular sectors using two stations and five checkpoints and whoever finishes first, or is the last creature standing, wins. All participants are required to arrive in their own personal fighter craft, and it is recommended that they bring as many combat ready support ships as possible. Competitors are encouraged to cheat by attacking and killing all opponents at the earliest opportunity, and they can use mines, missiles, poisonous gasses, and even chemically altered drinks as well as anything else imaginable that might cause harm to another contestant.\n\nWith surveillance cameras that transmit the unfolding events to millions of viewers throughout the universe, the route of "the Race" itself is only revealed moments before the start, so no contestant has knowledge of what lies ahead. It has recently become common practice to litter the track with devious traps, minefields, sensor disruptors and automated fighter drones, and the final highlight of the race occurs when the first player crosses the finish line. An automated timer then initiates a seven sezura countdown before detonating a large explosive device hidden in every race ship. The victor has the advantage of knowing when the countdown starts, and he usually has enough time to eject before the explosion occurs. Other participants however have no way of knowing when the device was activated, and there have been numerous occasions when over cautious racers have bailed, only to be evaporated in a stream of high energy plasma fired by their opponents.\n\nThis new sport has claimed more lives per event than any other competition in Split history and as such, it has been declared as the best space-based sporting activity ever by the Split Games Committee. Even though "the Race" is still not an officially recognised competition, tickets for attendance have been available for purchase from the black market for a long time now, and it does not appear that this deadly competition will fade from Split popularity any time soon.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2502">During the last wozura, a report has finally surfaced on the circumstances surrounding the death of the renowned physicist and Paranid Priest, \033WKetckoalmanckasaalt\033X. Initially it was assumed that Ketckoalmanckasaalt had gone into isolation and had begun a life as a hermit, but secret files obtained by undercover agents from within the High Paranid Historical Record Bureau have revealed that things are much more sinister than they appear.\n\nAccording to the secret files, which had been sealed with the personal mark of the High Priest King himself, Ketckoalmanckasaalt had been working on a theoretical branch of physics known as the interspatial resonances of the three complete dimensions. Only the Paranid are known to pursue and analyse the vague readings and complex theories regarding the interactions between space dimensions and time, and it seems that the missing scientist had unexpectedly achieved a momentous breakthrough. He had suddenly abandoned his work one tazura and had gone directly to the High Priest King who was his coordinator and supervisor.\n\nWhile this does not appear in any of the official records, the secret files seem to indicate that Ketckoalmanckasaalt had discovered actual proof of the fourth dimension, one which was much more complex and virtually inaccessible than previously thought compared to the other physical three dimensions. His findings apparently contradicted the Paranid belief that they could perceive three-dimensionality better than the other races because only they could subconsciously sense the existence of this fourth dimension. The Priest King had yelled that his findings were sinful and a treacherous blasphemy, the likes he had never heard of before. The audio files became confused at this point, but it has been deduced that there then appeared to have been a struggle, during which Ketckoalmanckasaalt was killed, and then immediately incinerated in one of the holy purging flames that are kept alight at all Paranid temples.\n\nSubsequent to this incident, Ketckoalmanckasaalt's entire staff have been 'reassigned' to various remote regions in Paranid space, all proof of his work appears to have been destroyed, and all scientific records amended to exclude any theories proposed by himself and his team. The High Priest King has refused to comment on the physicist's fate, though he did take the time to tell us that it was all slander without any inherent meaning, and that he would personally challenge the fool repeating the lies to a ceremonial duel to maintain the honour of the Paranid Empire.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News</t>

Previously neglected by almost all races, escape pods have now been in use for several decazuras but have not, until recently, enjoyed significant technical improvements to either their safety or reliability.\n\nThe latest generation of escape pods all have a similar basic design; each is equipped with high-speed engines and a one shot pre-charged jump drive that enables them to escape to safer space just sezuras after their launch. Each medium-sized pod can hold up to 27 Paranid or 40 Split beings and one pilot for emergencies, though the pods will normally be piloted by default using special pre-programmed computer software. Each pod is fully controlled by an autonomous launch mechanism with its own power source, resulting in the entire escape process being completely independent of the host ship's operational state. Although escape pods are reusable and able to make up to seven successful launches, they have to be thoroughly inspected for signs of damage after use, due to the extreme accelerations reached during each emergency flight. The interior of each pod is padded with a special gelatinous material that will save the escapees from death imposed by the lethal g-forces experienced during launch. The pod itself cannot generate artificial gravity, though if necessary this can be simulated by forcing the pod to roll on its main axis with an angular velocity of 27 degrees per sezura.\n\nIt has been officially ordered that all large ships purchased more than one mazura ago will have to go to the nearest shipyard for an upgrade. This will be free of charge only over the next two mazuras and after this time, the upgrade will cost a third of the ship's price. All ships sold within the last mazura have had escape pods installed as standard equipment as in future, it will be illegal to pilot a ship without escape pods being present and fitted correctly.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2531">New 'watch' technology overwhelms the Argon territory</t>
		<t id="2532">Over the past jazura, the trade between the Terrans and the Argon Federation has been steadily increasing, and one particular item has unexpectedly proven itself to be extremely popular among the Argon populace. An ancient design of time tracking device, commonly referred to as a "\033Wwrist\033X \033Wwatch\033X", has been dominating the shelves of fashionable Argon boutiques for several mazuras now. The only purpose of the "wrist watch" seems to be the display of two internal mechanical pointers that make a full rotation in a fixed amount of time, thus allowing for incredibly inaccurate time measurement.\n\nDespite the fact that such devices have no real reason to even exist in such advanced times, they seem to be popular as fashion accessories for the more affluent people among the Argons. The multitude of designs is astonishing, with watch sizes ranging from anywhere between a pin-point to a Split's head size in diameter - the latter, while still called "wrist watches" nonetheless, are too heavy to be carried around by a single person.\n\nA cult of wrist-watch fanatics named "the watchers" has sprung up on \033WArgon\033X \033WPrime\033X, and a member of "the watchers" will constantly arrive late to all social events, claiming that their watch was slow, even though it does not show proper Zuran time in the first place. It appears that even Senators of the Argon Federation are not immune from this obsession, and a number of them were recently several stazuras late to an important meeting due to an over reliance on these ridiculous devices.\n\nAmong the Terrans however, this new fad is somewhat lost. Interest in these devices has held steady throughout their entire history, and thankfully it has never escalated to these alarming levels. At the moment, all other races seem to have an inherent indifference to such useless trinkets, though the Teladi have negotiated repeatedly to gain sole rights to manufacture these on their own planets in large quantities.\n\nNorbert Hudson - Interstellar Broadcast Corporation</t>

		<t id="2541">New doomsayer cult gains popularity among the Split</t>
		<t id="2542">It appears that there always has to be at least one semi-official cult of universally recognised nut jobs. Now that the Goners have been proven to be right about the existence of Earth, the natural order of things seems to dictate that a new cult must take their place. It therefore seems that strange beliefs have once again been reinvented, and a completely new and probably even more insane cult has arisen from among the lesser Split families.\n\nThe members of this cult, called "\033WFollowers\033X \033Wof\033X \033Wthe\033X \033WEve\033X \033Wof\033X \033WDomination\033X", are claiming that the end of the whole universe is nigh, and that an astonishing event, called "\033Wthe\033X \033WEve\033X", will be the final sign of impending doom. According to them, upon the brink of "the Eve", everything without proper shielding will be removed from existence, the stars themselves will become a blurry mess, and the planets will turn irradiated and hostile to all. All this will be followed by the total collapse of every government and the ruin of economies as well as a complete disintegration of all social values. Cheating, swindling, pirating and murder will be abundant, and no-one will ever be able to feel safe again. The cult leaders involved are luring more and more people in with the promise of an abundance of easy killing and extreme amounts of violence... which is pretty much perfect music to any Split ears.\n\nA group of Boron analysts from the \033WMenelaus'\033X \033WRoyal\033X \033WScience\033X \033Wand\033X \033WSociology\033X \033WInstitute\033X have turned their attention to scrutinise the ideology of this cult to see whether there may be a grain of truth inherent within it. So far they have pointed out, merely as a result of theoretical assumptions, that if the so-called "Eve" should occur, the end result would be a highly unstable society without any discernible differences to primordial times. Large corporations and tribes would constantly battle for their share of influence over known territories, and life would be turned into the pure survival of the fittest. The Split cultists have however dismissed this hypothesis as nothing more than usual Boron slander.\n\nAt the moment, the cult is operating as all other cults have done in the past. They finance themselves from an expensive membership fee, and the followers are then forced to undertake a partial memory and personality wipe, this time induced chemically by an injection to the frontal brain lobe. We would like to warn all readers that these cultists have recently turned more and more desperate, trying to advance the onset of the "Eve of Domination" by new and extreme methods. A few of these individuals have recently been sentenced to 40 jazuras in the slave colonies, after they succeeded in destroying four civilian ships by unknown means. So if you by any chance see an Eve cultist, trying to give you flowers and pamphlets at the nearest spaceport, kindly refuse the offer, as it may be an explosive device in disguise.\n\nNeopsaris Trinitis Yosilamorphis III, Central Economy News</t>

		<t id="2551">Scientists find proof of Boron origins</t>
		<t id="2552">Ever since scientific collaboration between the Terran government and the Commonwealth races gained momentum, the top scientists from \033WEarth\033X have been working hard to find a correlation between Terran animals and the various alien races. This was done in order to prove a contentious theory, that the Earth was in fact the cradle for all contemporary life in the universe, and that the Ancients had moved several species to other planets, as part of a huge genetic experiment, to allow for different courses of evolution to occur. A major breakthrough was finally made last wozura, when the genome samples from select Boron volunteers proved to be a close match to the common Earth octopus.\n\nThis may prove to be one of mankind's greatest discoveries, as it may mean that the Boron race is not a completely unique form of life in itself, but is merely a mutated form of squid that had been introduced to a different environment early in its evolution. So far the Boron have refused to comment, though when they were first told the news, they immediately stormed off the scientific research facility and were only seen stazuras later back in \033WKingdom\033X \033WEnd\033X. It is not clear whether they were insulted or delighted to know more of their ancestry, but the Terran scientists are reluctant to press the Boron for comment, as they feel that it may have been too large of a shock to learn that your ancestors once came from Earth itself.\n\nThis discovery has created a new predicament, several high-ranking Terran sociologists and economists are now saying that since the Boron are derived from Earth animals, they should be treated as such and be subject to Terran rules and legislation. This would mean that they should obey all Terran laws regarding colonial settlements and receive standard anti-disease vaccines that were forced on all surviving animals 500 jazuras ago to avoid a self-inflicted extinction. Naturally, some of these new developments might be hard to accept for the Boron people, but we at \033WTerran\033X \033WMorning\033X \033WNews\033X are certain that the calm, peaceful and fishy nature of the Boron will not prove to be an obstacle to the acceptance of human superiority.\n\nThe latest reports tell us that the scientists of the alien genome project have now begun to look for Paranid matches amongst the Earth's bug and insect population. Though so far they have already dismissed all of the arachnids and most of the flying insects, the dung beetle genome has proven to be a suspiciously close match to the Paranids.\n\nEmma Whi - Terran Morning News</t>

		<t id="2561">Terrans insult the Kingdom of Boron with mock research</t>
		<t id="2562">During the last few mazuras, the Boron scientific community has been actively involved in a new and unique Terran-funded project, searching for commonly occurring characteristics in both Terran aquatic creatures and the Boron. This is to see whether Earth's animals are potentially able to evolve to sentient levels, and if not, what the reasons might be that holds them back. A breakthrough of sorts has been achieved, but the Terran scientists have shockingly turned the tables. They are now claiming that the discovery of a minor correlation between two genome fragments implies that the Boron race itself has originated from the common Earth octopus - a small and pitiful nautical creature that prowls the shallow recesses of seas on Earth.\n\nIt appears that the Terrans have used the genome project as an false excuse to gather genetic samples from all races; they then used the results of dubious and laughable experimental research to gain elevated social status, and to try and prove themselves the superior of all Commonwealth races. Queen Menelaus has issued an official warning to the Terrans on behalf of the Kingdom of Boron, stating if they choose to pursue this research, and continue to insist on any legal rights inferred by dubious scientific theories, she would order all trade contact and military collaboration to be cut off entirely. The Terran Ambassador has yet to respond to this statement, but we gather from official sources that the Terrans will not let this go easily. They claim this new discovery has implications that could be used as a legal basis to consider the whole of Boron territory to be a colony of the Terran government, and thus the Boron people would be liable to pay Terran taxes.\n\nThe Split representatives have already said that it was about time that someone proved that the Borons were unworthy of being called a race, while the Teladi and Paranids have not expressed their views one way or the other. The Argon Federation has sided with the Kingdom of Boron, and the Senators have voted to lend full support should there be an armed conflict. Everyone is hoping this will not escalate to a dangerous stand-off, as with the ongoing colonisation of the Expansion Region, the resources of all the races are now stretched very thin, and yet another conflict is not something that anyone can afford right now.\n\nNoko Lu - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

		<t id="2572">The Argon research and deep space exploration ship, the '\033WPandora\033X', has just sent an encrypted message back to the command centre in \033WSirius\033X \033WPrime\033X. It appears that they have found a large cache of unused ship extensions in the furthest regions of a newly discovered sector, possibly left floating there after an explosion on a highly advanced ship. The extensions seem to be compatible with all known ships currently in production, but the location has been lost due to an intense radiation burst from a nearby star wiping the coordinates from the ship's navigational systems.\n\nThe entire crew were also affected and they seem to have been struck with a case of collective amnesia; they can't remember the sector the discovery was made in. The crew have reportedly said that they were far away from the ecliptic, but stationary in position on a single general axis within a sector that might have already been thoroughly explored or perhaps just only recently discovered. The only other vague information they can remember is that the sun was distant, but not too far away, and there were also moderate amounts of stars to be seen as well as either a blue, green, red, black, white or pink nebula. They all seemed to agree however that it was one of the newer sectors located in the so-called Expansion Region though, so treasure hunters in the Commonwealth are out of luck this time.\n\nThe crew members of the 'Pandora' seem to be unsure on the type and exact number of the ship extensions found, but they have agreed it was probably somewhere between two and eight.\n\nJack Stone - Interstellar Broadcast Corporation</t>

		<t id="2581">Aldrian-Argon deal fails due to spelling error</t>
		<t id="2582">After the colonisation of the new Argon territories, both Argon and Aldrian trade moguls laboured for many mazuras to expand into each other's markets, diversifying their stock in order to gain as much profit as possible. A major trade deal that had been submitted for Argon judicial approval has just been denied ratification, in spite of the fact that it would have guaranteed a net gain of more than \033Y400\033X \033Ymillion\033X \033Ycredits\033X for both races. The grounds for dismissal are almost ludicrous and it's all over a simple word that is often used in Solara space, but is considered incorrect in Argon language use. The problem is with the past tense of the word 'pay' - this single word used in the submitted trade deal documents apparently renders them erroneous and so therefore unacceptable. The Aldrians have always used the word 'payed', and it is considered by them to be the only accurate form of the word, and is thus taught so in schools and written into their laws. The Argons and the Terrans however use the irregular form of the word 'paid' in its place, and according to them, it is the only correct form due to vowel placement or some-such other grammatical rule.\n\nWhile the trade deal documents could be re-written, as well as marked, checked, accepted and the signing repeated; passing through all these procedures once again will mean a further half-jazura delay that will result in an estimated profit reduction by as much as two thirds of the original value. The Solara Ambassador of Trade and Fiscal Relations in Argon space has now said that this is all just complete and utter incompetence on behalf of the Argons. He further stated that the whole difficulty is only being created simply because a few high-ranking politicians in the Argon Government felt that this deal would divert profits from their semi-legal businesses, and jeopardise their near monopoly within certain trading sectors. The Argon government has yet to respond to this accusation.\n\nMatt Jirodd - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2591">Is Solara government hereditary?</t>
		<t id="2592">It is general knowledge that the Terran Government is the result of thousands of jazuras of continuous political evolution. We have a system that allows the people to take part in the governance of their own race, by electing representatives from their own midst to stand up for their needs, rights and desires. However, things appear far from ideal within the Solara government. The \033WTerran\033X \033WMorning\033X \033WNews\033X research crew has just discovered that the currently "elected" ruler of the Aldrian people is the son of the previous ruler, who in turn is also a cousin of the self-appointed President who has ruled \033WSolara\033X over the last twenty-jazuras. Further analysis of the history of the Solara governments reveals that a single large family or dynasty if you like, has held the most powerful governing seats for more than 300 jazuras throughout the recent history of \033WAldrin\033X.\n\nThe most curious thing though, is that despite such practices of inheriting power from one's relatives being forbidden even under Solara law, the common populace have apparently acquiesced to this for a long time now. The "electorate" seem strangely willing to turn a blind eye to the corruption amongst their leaders and are content with criminals ruling over them for decazuras. It could be said that the whole of Solara is essentially ruled by a mafia family, and the tell-tale signs of this pervade all aspects of Aldrian society. The power is held by a single family with control over both the government and numerous key businesses in their area of interest.\n\nAs the Terrans managed to solve similar problems with their own large mafia families in the 2657th jazura, our government has kindly offered to help eradicate corruption from the Solara government at a small price. This would be in exchange for several new regulations being agreed that would have only a minor impact upon the average Aldrian citizen.\n\nEmma Whi - Terran Morning News</t>

		<t id="2602">The infamous yellow paper going by the innocent name of the '\033WTerran\033X \033WMorning\033X \033WNews\033X', has now claimed in a recent article that our government is nothing more than a nepotistic, mafia-owned front. It is well known that our leaders are in their positions due to their enormous skill and continued concern for the welfare of our own people, and such accusations thrown around irresponsibly without any care or afterthought of the consequences is most unacceptable. By itself, this slander would not be too concerning, but it unfortunately coincides with the recent proposal to our government from an obscure branch of the \033WTerran\033X \033WAnti-Corruption\033X \033WBureau\033X, in which they offer the Aldrians help in dealing with the "endemic deep corruption and criminal activities of the dysfunctional Solara government".\n\nThis "offer" has understandably caused great anger in the political elite of \033WAldrin\033X. If the Terrans had expressed the same sentiments to any other race, or if the Aldrian people had pointed out the Terran government is no better but simply more deceitful to their general population, they would have immediately called for recompense and an apology for slander.\n\nKaren Styles - Solara News Network</t>

		<t id="2611">A political fugitive reveals Aldrian secrets</t>
		<t id="2612">We have just been informed that a jazura and a half ago, a certain Aldrian politician fled \033WAldrin\033X and sought refuge among the Terran people. At the time, he was immediately offered protection and a new identity in return for the disclosure of any secrets or other 'sensitive' information concerning the Solara Government. \033WLeon\033X \033WBronstein\033X was a People's Commissar for Solara Foreign Affairs, a position that while allowing for unlimited access to internal secrets, forbade him from influencing anything without the consent of his superiors.\n\nIt is known that he fled because he could "no longer take the blatant lies of the government, the back-handed deals of the ministers, the falsehoods that were presented as facts, the regular alteration of important historical documents and the continued censorship and oppression of free thought." Because of his rather liberal and progressive ideas, the more influential Aldrian ministers found him to be an increasing nuisance in their well-oiled machinery of corruption and crime. Due to the threat that Leon posed, the Terran Secret Service had revealed to him that he and his whole family were in danger of imminent political assassination. According to Leon, the whole government of \033WSolara\033X is beyond mere petty corruption. It has essentially become the continuous rule of single political elite that promotes communal utopia as a cover for shady deals, illegal business practices and countless millions spent on government projects purely for their own personal gain.

		<t id="2621">The Goner faction now and then</t>
		<t id="2622">The Goners are a semi-religious group of Argons that upheld the memory of \033WEarth\033X and the heroic exploits of \033WNathan\033X \033WR.\033X \033WGunne\033X throughout the 800 jazura long isolation of the Commonwealth from the Earth. They predicted that Earth would be revealed, and although this actually came to pass just three jazuras ago, what has happened to them since that time? Why are they not renowned and famous for their predictions, and why are they still being frowned upon when their long cause has been proven to be so just?\n\nThe nearly universal scorn that the Goners receive is rooted in both current events and their own ideology. Firstly, over the jazuras the Goners evolved into a religion of sorts, a type of sect, and with their incessant preaching and trouble-making they eventually alienated themselves with all the races of the Commonwealth, even the Argons. A long history of isolation and rejection left the Goners without a natural sense of belonging and many people even now consider them as a separate race.\n\nSecondly, they always advocated \033WEarth\033X as a kind of utopia, an ideal towards which everyone should strive. The Goner vision of Earth was not that of a planet of origin, but they alluded to Earth as a kind of a paradise, a place where there would be no trouble, no conflict, and no poverty. When the true Earth was discovered, not without their own participation, it soon became clear that their precious Earth was already taken by the Terrans, and these new people turned out to be less than welcoming of their long lost brothers, eyeing them with as much suspicion as they would any other alien race. Earth was not the perfect place that was promised; it turned out to be a planet no different to \033WArgon\033X \033WPrime\033X, with the same problems, troubles and politics that burden the Argon citizens. This led to a large majority of people losing faith in what the Goners had to say, and to consider them as mere con artists and charlatans unworthy of trust.\n\nFurthermore, it seemed that now that Earth had been revealed, the Goners had lost their main reason for existence, and indeed, for the first jazura they were racked by doubt and internal dissent and for a while there was almost no activity whatsoever from them. In truth, they nearly faced a schism, with almost half of their followers saying that the Goners had to be dissolved entirely, and the rest insisting that there had to be reforms and the foundation of a new shining path to follow. In the end, they agreed to become negotiators between the Argons and the Terrans, a position not entirely championed by either race.\n\nIn reality, the Goners are presently the same as they were ten jazuras ago, generally mistrusted, universally scorned and more or less ignored. What their future goals are is not clear. A popular rumour however is that they have found a new mythical planet that is said to be the origin of all life in the universe, and that they are now searching for anything left by the ancients to determine what they were and if they still exist somewhere. It could be said that the Goners have had a great influence on the universe, and it is surprising that so little has changed regarding them in the grand scheme of things.\n\nSam Bunweiss - Special Reporter, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2631">A new era for passenger transports?</t>
		<t id="2632">Although military ships of all classes have enjoyed renewed interest lately, with ship design and production companies focusing on combat enhancements, the market for civilian transporters appears almost dead and the future looks bleak. Station and freight transporters have stuck to their well-developed, but ancient ways, and their pilots are quite content with the status quo. Even the newer military transports, the \033WTM\033X \033Wclass\033X, are not much more than a hardened transporter, with cargo containers replaced with a framework for docking fighters.\n\nSomewhat ironically, no ship class has experienced a greater decline in popularity than the passenger transport, also known as the luxury people transporter. Initially designed to serve as a VIP shuttle, and as a limousine of sorts, the quality of passenger transporters has steadily declined over time, losing almost all of the mandatory luxury and 'very important' part of the term VIP. Common passenger transporter models, such as the Argon '\033WExpress\033X' and Split '\033WIguana\033X' are basically re-worked freighters, with an additional life support module fitted among the cargo containers to carry people. They are pretty much the same as busses and coaches on colonised worlds - cheap, dirty, and basic in their form of public transportation. While the well-known "Tour of the Lifetime" company has operated with increasing losses each jazura due to the continued decline of interest in their services, the average military scout class ship, fitted with basic extensions to support extra life forms aboard, can do a far better job than slow bulky passenger transporters when it comes competing for quick taxi fares or longer voyages. The sales market for passenger transporter vessels is probably the smallest of any class in the ship building industry, and the demand for this type of ship is at an all-time low right now. Unless there are radical changes in passenger transport design and production, the TP class will soon disappear from the space lanes.\n\nLuckily, such a change has already begun. With the increase of free traders successfully competing against corporation merchants, the universe has seen a large rise in the number of billionaire trade moguls. These people started their road to success with naught more than a basic ship and few credits to their name, and now that they have made it big, they feel a necessity for their own luxury ship, something that displays aesthetics, high quality build materials and lavish custom interior decorations. The first of the new passenger transport ships specifically built to cater for wealthy customers was the Boron '\033WAngel\033X'. Originally a personal transport for the Queen herself, the Angel is now a mass-production model and already famous for its signature silhouette, luxurious interior and rather impressive technical statistics.\n\nThe Paranid have also released their own version of a luxury passenger transport ship, a newly redesigned version of the '\033WHyperion\033X', previously known to be the favourite vessel of the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia himself. Initially designed as a combat ship, the Hyperion proved to be far too expensive to build with all the numerous adjustments necessary for it to even pass basic combat performance trials. Now, stripped of the ill-fitting war machinery, the Hyperion was re-launched as a passenger transport, and quickly proved to be a worthy competitor to the Angel. Both of these ships have such a strong market presence, that other ship building companies are now also working on their very own prototypes to compete with both the Boron and the Paranid offerings.\n\nThe Argon, for example, have already released a working model of their very own design, though it has yet to gain popularity with the intended buyers. So things are not as grim as they appear, and it is becoming more apparent that the new passenger transporter ship variants are here to stay. The question is, what will happen to the old models from the previous generation of the passenger transporters?\n\nLau t'Nggl - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2641">Are spaceflies the creators of the universe?</t>
		<t id="2642">A recent study, conducted by a team of Argon, Boron and even Paranid scientists, has revealed surprising intelligence amongst the spacefly population that may turn out to be the greatest discovery of all time. The team was assembled two jazuras ago with the goal to fill in the gaps of our collective knowledge on these space critters, their lives, purpose and genetics. Before now, it was generally considered that spaceflies were non-intelligent semi-organic beings that were only good for recycling ship debris, zapping into your shields, splatting against the hull of your ship, and possibly useful for power generation in certain Split devices. Beyond that, no real knowledge has ever been gained in respect of these creatures.\n\nThe study was conducted in three phases. In the beginning, a large swarm of 500 spaceflies was gathered, and each individual specimen was equipped with a special tracking/recording device and released in a random part of the universe. The flies were tracked by automated systems for more than three mazuras, and the video feed was gathered on various data loggers located all over Argon, Boron, Paranid and Teladi space. After a specified time had passed, the small tracker devices were switched off and automatically jettisoned from the spaceflies.\n\nExamination of the collected data has revealed that there seems to be a pattern to all swarm movements, and it was observed that each swarm flies in a circle, spanning on average four to eight sectors and often stealthily crossed jump gate event horizons. It appeared that the swarms each had their own territory, as they almost never crossed into an area occupied by another swarm, although they often came close, sweeping past each other with only a few hundred metres between them. The individual movement of the flies within a swarm was also most surprising; it turned out that all of the little creatures always fly in a certain formation, apparently evolved over time to simulate a random movement. Despite this, the underlying pattern revealed itself upon closer examination and the surprising thing is that the pattern was rigorously kept by all swarms despite the distances between them, and pursued with an incredible precision. Never was there a case when even one creature deviated from the underlying swarm pattern.\n\nThe second phase was a field test on how spaceflies communicate. A sample group of 100 spaceflies was gathered in a vast laboratory and subjected to a series of tests; these were designed to reveal whether there is any form of communication between the creatures, and how definitive it might be. It soon became clear that all spaceflies are able to relay extremely detailed information to the swarm by merely shifting the frequency of the electromagnetic waves they constantly emit. The spaceflies had no trouble relaying the location, size, colour and other characteristics of a multitude of objects, and it even seemed that the flies could decide upon a common future action of the swarm depending on recent events and experience. This sole observation seems to indicate that the spaceflies are much, much more intelligent than we had ever suspected. A few of the scientists studying these beings even suggested that they were, in fact, something akin to von Neumann probes, much like what the early Xenon were.\n\nThe third test however, was the most groundbreaking. A full genetic examination of a spacefly was carried out to determine what they are made of, and how they function. It turned out that the DNA of a spacefly was unlike that of any other creature known in existence. While all life forms currently existing on planets and crossing the universe in their spaceships are carbon-based, spacefly DNA is actually a mix of carbon-based nuclides and silicon-based chemical structures previously unknown to general science. The whole structure of the latterly simple spacefly turned out to be vastly more complex than that of the smartest of Borons, who up till now were considered to be the most genetically complex living creatures. The DNA of a spacefly is of a meticulous design, but one thing in particular caught the attention of the scientists - the spacefly had a special gene that prevented them from undergoing any mutation, effectively blocking their evolutionary path forever. This has led the scientists to propose a whole new theory. In this, they claim that all their experimental findings are solid enough to prove that the spaceflies are not in fact natural creatures, but ones that were genetically designed, by the ancients perhaps, for unknown purposes, maybe even for the maintenance of the fabric of space itself.\n\nThis last conclusion has created a serious rift in the scientific elite, with the majority dismissing the theory and declaring the whole research as ridiculous and a hoax. With a minority continuing to support these revelations, nobody knows what the ramifications of this discovery will be; it may even turn out that the spaceflies are the ancients themselves!\n\nSam Bunweiss - Special Reporter, GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2651">The search for UFO base continues</t>
		<t id="2652">The UFOs that literally plague the Commonwealth, and now the Expansion Region too, are pretty much of an enigma to all. There is no data as to what their function is and no information as to their allegiance or capability. The Goners had previously assumed the role of protectors over them, claiming that they surely deserved to be left alone and unmolested, simply because they had not shown any hostile intent towards other beings.\n\nSeveral major expeditions have been launched in the past to determine whether these UFOs have a central base, a place where they are built, stored and repaired. Until now, these efforts have been widely unsuccessful, as even though the authorities have launched hundreds of drones to follow the UFOs continuously, none of the UFOs ever docked or ever came close to anything that could be considered their place of origin.\n\nScientists are now however calling for more funds from their governments to launch a completely different type of search operation. They have examined the data of all recorded UFO sightings in the last 20 jazuras, identifying areas that these ships seemingly avoid or conversely visit frequently on their travels. According to leading academics in spacefly research, the data has been narrowed down to about 35 promising locations that show large deviations from what might be considered 'normal' UFO activity. As one of these may be a key to the UFO base whereabouts, these locations are being kept secret for now, and unless the base is actually found, you will never know whether your local Solar Power Plant or Massom Mill was at one point being thought of as the secret UFO base. Nevertheless, we ask all readers to continue being vigilant to anything unprecedented happening in their vicinity, and if you happen to spot a large construction far off among the stars, call the \033WGalNet\033X \033WNews\033X hotline as soon as possible. For all you know, the truth, along with fame, fortune and probable insanity, just might be out there.\n\nMull Derscan - GalNet News</t>

		<t id="2661">The 'Murdering Priest' returns!</t>
		<t id="2662">Seven jazuras ago, a tragedy gripped the media. Having assumed the fake identity of a Goner missionary, a crazy psychopath infiltrated a Trading Station and using purpose-made poison sprays, murdered a large number of people. He was only caught four mazuras after the incident and barely in time to prevent another repetition of a similar killing spree in a nearby sector. He was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to 400 jazuras in cryogenic suspension. The police have now announced that a few wozuras ago, a hacker assault on the mainframe controlling the cryogenic containers, combined with an unexplained power failure, has led to the premature defrosting of this dangerous psycho. Awakened, he escaped the holding facility by leaping into a conveniently parked fighter that was left nearby.\n\nThe police suspect that a pirate clan may be behind this operation, as these circumstances are far too unlikely to all occur naturally together. The increased danger lies in the fact that all identity codes were erased from the database shortly afterwards, leaving no possible way of deducing the criminal's next move. The Argon Chief of Police has instructed all races to look out for any suspiciously behaving Goner preachers, and if possible, keep them away from stations containing large numbers of civilian as a precaution. The Goners have said that this advice is an infringement of their legal rights, and that any restrictions placed on them should be withdrawn immediately.\n\nAccording to the Goners, no one has probably actually escaped and this is all just a big hoax simply to further restrict Goner activities. This might seem a common paranoid reaction, but there may be a grain of truth in these accusations. The Argon Police representatives have not revealed the reason for applying this law in the Expansion Region as well as the Commonwealth, when there is no possible way in which the psychopath could have crossed through \033WPandora's\033X \033WGate\033X and into the \033WSolara\033X system.\n\nNeil Flounder - Interstellar Broadcast Corporation</t>

		<t id="2672">Although the pleasure complex is a relatively new concept, initially devised by the Yaki, it has gained popularity relatively fast. Successful entrepreneurs and frustrated pilots alike are known to frequent these rare and elusive stations. Now, a group of Split station owners have petitioned for a new law that would allow pleasure complexes to be built legally in Split space. The main thinking behind this law is the argument that if a Split has worked like a warrior, he should rest and relax like one as well. They were quick to point out that only such soft creatures like the Boron and Argon would object to a pleasure complex and that in reality, it would not differ that much from a normal food factory.\n\nUntil now, there has been no official response to the proposition, but the petitioners are determined to push their suggestion forward and as it would provide a good alternative for the use of slaves, the numbers of which have risen significantly over the last jazura. The petitioners are so convinced of success that they have formed a company called "\033WThe\033X \033WLeague\033X \033Wof\033X \033WFrustrated\033X \033WGentlemen\033X".\n\nSnt t'Kggh - Split Clan News</t>

		<t id="2682">As shown by the latest political analysis, the Split families \033WScct\033X and \033WZrt\033X are equally powerful, and they are only surpassed by the ever more powerful family \033WRhonkar\033X. Both of these families have received permission to create their own rule within the sectors they have captured, and differences are now beginning to show. The Scct family has adopted an aggressive policy based on being heavily armed and military strong, whilst also maintaining relatively cool relations with the Patriarch.\n\nThe Zrt family however, has given up all their assets in the Commonwealth and moved completely to the Expansion Region. Though a risky move at the time, it may result in them gaining ownership of the outer most regions of the Split territories. They are openly hostile against the Scct family, and while not actually at war, no Scct ship is allowed to land on a Zrt-controlled station. The Patriarch is known to have used this mutual hatred to maintain his own influence over the families, but the balance is fragile. All families know that if the Zrt or the Scct gain a significant advantage over the other, they would be strong enough to assume full control over all Split territories in the Expansion Region, especially since the Commonwealth sectors are currently inaccessible.\n\nWith this in mind, reports of Split ships attacking each other in non-controlled regions of space have increased over the last few mazuras, perhaps alluding to a secret war among the families themselves.\n\nSnt t'Kggh - Split Clan News</t>

		<t id="2692">A Split police captain was forced to resign in shame last wozura, after suspicions were confirmed that he was issuing space fuel as a mental booster for his subordinate pilots. This particular captain had been renowned over the last few jazuras for always managing to maintain the ferocity and aggressiveness in his pilots that could never be equalled by any other police or military division. Due to a large number of friendly fire and crash landing accidents, an investigation was begun to determine whether there was something wrong with the pilots. A number of random checks surprisingly revealed that the pilots were suffering from almost constant inebriation from space fuel. When questioned, they revealed that the captain had forced them to drink copious amounts of the booze in order to boost their combat prowess. Needless to say, such practice had already been declared by the Patriarch several generations ago as shameful. The captain will not be facing trial however, Split scientists are interested in researching the effects of space fuel on Split pilots and how it could be rationed to provide just the right amount of effect without the obvious drawbacks.\n\nDzt t'Kddt - Split Clan News</t>

His latest find was on one of the newer planets just discovered, and it is a large reptilian creature well over two metres tall, with vicious teeth and claws. The creature, as yet unnamed, will first be seen in the arena in one of the Split sectors to be announced soon. The \033WSplit\033X \033WSports\033X \033WCommission\033X said that the unknown creature was "obviously uncivilised and extremely violent, thus making it the perfect animal for one-on-one gladiatorial fights." The other civilizations have asked to see the creature before the first match fixture to confirm that it is indeed not a sentient creature, but negotiations are still ongoing at this moment. We hope the other races will keep their empathy in check and primitive religious beliefs to themselves, and let us get on with what promises to be a great match between the creature and any Split warriors that wish to challenge it.\n\nSplit Family News - Sports Report</t>

		<t id="2892">The two identical twin girls, \033WBola\033X \033WHa\033X and Bola Na, have won yet another synchronised swimming meet after scoring a perfect 100 points at the Water Sports Arena on \033WLucky\033X \033WPlanets\033X. While other families have had great swimmers and synchronised teams in the past, these two are way above the average swimming team in both great looks and fantastic swimming technique. The judges were wowed by their routines, which covered everything from leaps that cleared the water by at least three metres and delicate swimming to classical music. Their performance was so spellbinding that several schools have asked to use the video recordings for instructional purposes and the family has agreed, stating that classical Boron ballet was used to train them. When the two twins were asked about their newest victory, they both just blushed and thanked their parents for their good upbringing and great training, once again showing why they have been called the "perfect daughters of perfect parents". The entire faculty of their school has nothing but admiration for them and their parents, they never miss a single meet or practice session, and the girls are given proper advice and guidance for every possible situation.\n\nWith this latest win, the team gets a short rest until the next match and so they now get to go home to their family's estate to see friends and loved ones. We thank them for their selfless work to make themselves into this near perfect team and hope they continue to astound us for many years to come.\n\nRoyal Commonwealth News - Special Report</t>

		<t id="2901">Timing error costs mission</t>
		<t id="2902">While taking a mission to the outer sectors, a certain mercenary \(who shall remain nameless at his request...\) failed to deliver the necessary supplies to a station in the time required and the station itself was destroyed. The Solara government said in a statement that the man was not at fault. That he encountered massive enemy presence and had to literally fight his way through the sectors alone and the time limit expired before he made it there. While the loss of the station is being taken badly, and many are asking who this man was and wither it really was excusable not to make it in time, the government is holding firm by withholding his name for "his immediate security". It is a sad tazura for use all, as members of the family mourn their losses, both financial and personal.\n\nGail Marks - Solara System News</t>

		<t id="2912">In a prepared statement, the Argon government said that an investigation into a possible assassination attempt brought forth news that one corporate leader was indeed targeted by an enemy mercenary and nearly lost his life before reinforcements arrived. The man in question is alive this tazura only because of the fast flying of some local security men who rushed to his aid and stopped the assassination by destroying the ship of the hired killer just sezuras before he finished his job. While much is unknown about the man and his mission, there is a huge investigation ongoing and any new leads and information on this incident will be made available as soon as it is found.\n\nBen Hurt - Interstellar News Network</t>

		<t id="2921">Station destroyed as mercenaries watch on</t>
		<t id="2922">In an attempt to save his station owner \033WJames\033X \033WFranz\033X called for help from any and all fighters in the area. The station was under heavy attack and the shields were failing. The men and women who rushed to his aid fought valiantly but the station was destroyed by sheer numbers and the pilots that responded found themselves the target of a large number of enemy forces the second the station fell. Many did not escape but those that did were quoted as saying: "if only we could have been there sooner..." and then sadly walked away. The sight of the exploding station will undoubtedly stick in the minds of those that survived and we thank them for giving their best in a losing situation. The government has come out saying that the remaining mercenaries are not at fault, and should not be chastised for their failure.\n\nBen Hunt - Interstellar News Network</t>

		<t id="2931">Mission failure due to bad planning as per government investigation</t>
		<t id="2932">A pilot \( whose name is being withheld for his safety \), offered to take a mission to help fight off an attacking force some three sectors away. The mission had a short time limit, and when he accepted it, the officers in charge didn't ask for another pilot to help him, saying he assured them he was capable. The truth was: his ship was neither fast enough nor well enough armed to do the mission, and the security forces in the area said they saw him "flying along looking at the scenery" while the sector in question fell to the opposing forces. The government is holding the man pending further investigation, and possible charges are being considered for his thoughtless actions. Be careful to consider all options when taking missions, if you aren't really confident you can do it, for god's sake let someone know or refuse the mission, lives are at stake.\n\nRity Fist - Galactic News Network</t>

		<t id="2942">\033WPhillip\033X \033WMorris\033X, of the Terran hardball team the \033WNY\033X \033WYankees\033X, this tazura got the most prestigious award that professional hardball can give. The fabulous MVP award is given just once in a decade to the most deserving player in recent history. The Commissioner of Hardball stated that quote: "Phillip has been an exceptional player for over a decade, and off the field his personal life has mirrored the best that Terra has to offer. From inspiring our youth to strive for excellence in themselves, to donating large sums of money to charitable organizations, he has shown that perfection as a player and a man is still possible in our time." The award was given at the Hardball Hall of Fame in NY City and during the service; his statue was unveiled right next to the statue of \033WChad\033X \033WNegrin\033X, his former teammate and lifelong friend. It is a great tazura for \033WTerra\033X and Hardball and we hope many more such hero's can be found in our time.\n\nBen Hunt - Interstellar News Network</t>

		<t id="2952">After three wozuras in the \033WIngowey\033X \033WDesert\033X, the Split survival champ, \033WHnt\033X \033WT'Kon\033X returned to his base camp for the official results of his latest trip. The Survival Council was amazed when after that long a time; it was found he actually gained weight. When asked how that could be possible, he simply smiled and said: "It's impossible to lose weight in the desert as food is in great abundance everywhere you look, from snakes to grubs to reptiles of all sizes." It might be true, but to think it was possible to gain two kilos during the trip was a new record and the Council decided that he needed to take a team out and prove to them what he did and where he stayed during that time. While his first instincts were to attempt to kill the judges, they soon got him under control and he walked into the desert with the appointed team and they will return after they are satisfied that his trip was indeed approved by the Council. If it turns out to be true, then his record will stand very possibly for a very long time, and he will be awarded accordingly.\n\nHnt T'Ht - Split Family News</t>

		<t id="2961">Boron pilot loses battle</t>
		<t id="2962">The Boron representative this tazura gave an official apology to a family that lost their station due to the incompetence of a team of Boron mercenaries that showed up to defend it. The commanding captain said that after getting there in lots of time; their weapons misfired causing the stations shields to take damage from the close use of \033WIon\033X \033WDisruptors\033X while during the battle. The fight did indeed send the enemies out of the system but the station took damage that it definitely would not have had if those weapons were not in use. "This is a bad tazura for Boron's everywhere; the team that arrived managed to chase the enemies away, but actually helped them drop the stations shields until it took damage from the last round of missiles fired as the pirate ships retreated. The local Boron representative says that the mercenary team is responsible for the damage and it will be taken from any other payment they receive in the next few wozuras, or until it is paid in full." While this was a great tragedy, we hope this serves as a lesson to other Boron pilots out there, the right weapon for the right job, and be careful what is going on around you, as even missed shots can cause damage to friendly craft.\n\nHala Hi - Royal Commonwealth News</t>

The team leader that showed up to defend the sector from enemy attack managed to hold off an overwhelming number of enemy ships hoping for reinforcements that never arrived. The unnamed pilot \(at the Family's request\) is being given a memorial on his home colony by his immediate family and his name will be remembered with honour and reverence by those who knew him. When asked about the incident, the Minister of Split Security said "We can all be sure he fought bravely until the very end, and we all hope to show as much bravery and dignity when our time comes." Once again one of us has shown the galaxy our hearts and we praise him for his work and for his life.\n\nRot T'Cor - Split Family News</t>

		<t id="2982">\033WDan\033X \033WMangus\033X, a first rate runner and champion of several Argon long distance races was disqualified from his latest win when it was found he was taking performance enhancing drugs whilst running. The idea of the long distance run was always to have runners travel great distances as quickly as possible, and used open roads and paths so every runner could see every type of running surface, from smooth flat roads to hills and wooded paths. This however has made the idea of cheating somewhat easier, as officials can't see the players as well in many places along the route. Enter \033WTerracorp\033X \033WElectronics\033X, a subsidiary of the famous Terracorp engine design team. They have made new scanners that can detect illegal substances in the blood from as far away as two kilometres. Using this technology , the officials saw evidence that Dan was using stimulants along the route when no one was watching, and the effects ran out before he made it all the way back, making them undetectable under normal circumstances. This new technology will undoubtedly change the way events are held, and some sports teams are already demanding notice ahead of time before its use, the Council on Sports is however refusing. \033WDan\033X \033WMangus\033X has lost his place as champion of the marathon, and charges have been filed against him and his coach, further news on this scandal will be forthcoming, I'm sure.\n\nBen Hunt - Interstellar News Network</t>

		<t id="3002">A supply convoy, piloted by several mercenary hired by the station to get emergency supplies to it, was destroyed after a massive enemy force attacked it immediately after it came out of the gate and started towards the station. Their escorts tried to assist them but the slow freighters never made it to the safety of the station or gate, and were destroyed leaving no one alive. Only one escort vessel survived and flew back to the core sector to report the incident. The local security teams have been sent to search out the enemy force and eliminate it before any more lives are lost. We offer our condolences to the families of the lost men and women, and we hope the security forces will avenge them soon.\n\nRity Fist - GalNet News Network</t>

The man said that he was on a mission to escort freighters from one sector to another and they were attacked repeatedly by enemy ships. He managed to fight off several vessels before being overwhelmed by sheer numbers and barely escaped with his life. The security team reported that debris from several other ships was floating nearby, and corroborated his story. No charges are being filed at this time on the pilot who himself lost everything in the battle.\n\nHata Hi - Royal Commonwealth News</t>
